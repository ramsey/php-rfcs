===== Introduction =====

The backtick operator (''`dir D:\foo`'') is used to execute commands via shell. The same functionality is also available as ''shell_exec()''.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to deprecate it in PHP 7.3 and suggest to use ''shell_exec()'' instead, in case PHP decided in future to use backtick enclosed strings for Unicode strings.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Proposed PHP Version: =====

7.3

===== Voting =====

2/3 majority will be required.
