===== Introduction =====

Let's get rid of ext/mcrypt, which is abandonware and inhibits the growth of the language, as soon as humanly possible.

===== Proposal =====

In PHP 7.1, all mcrypt_* functions will raise an E_DEPRECATED notice.

In PHP 7.1+1 (be it 7.2 or 8.0), the mcrypt extension will be moved out of core and into PECL, where people who *really* want to install it may still do so if they can install PHP extensions from PECL.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Any cryptography code that depends on mcrypt will need to be refactored against openssl.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Deprecation: Next minor version (7.1.0).

Removal from core: The following major/minor version (7.2.0 or 8.0.0).


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Vote "Yes" to raise an E_DEPRECATED notice in PHP 7.1 when any mcrypt function is used and to remove the extension from core in 7.1+1.

Since this would break backwards compatiblity, a 2/3 is appropriate.

===== Patches and Tests =====

If this RFC is accepted, I will author the patch to expunge ext/mcrypt.
