===== Introduction =====
FFI is one of the features that made Python and LuaJIT very useful for fast prototyping. It allows calling C functions and use C data types from pure scripting language and therefore develop "system code" more productively. For PHP, FFI opens a way to write PHP extensions and bindings to C libraries in pure PHP. 

===== Proposal =====
It is proposed to extend PHP with a simple FFI API designed after LuaJTI/FFI and Python/CFFI (actually, the second was based on the first). This API allows loading shared libraries (.DLL or .so), calling C functions and accessing C data structures, in pure PHP, without learning 3rd "intermediate" language.

The public API is implemented as a single class **FFI** with few static methods (some of them may be called non-statically), and overloaded object methods, that perform actual interaction with C data. Before diving into the details of FFI API, take a look into few examples, to see, how it's simple to use this API for regular tasks.

==== Calling a function from shared library ====
<code php>
<?php
// create FFI object, loading libc and exporting function printf()
$ffi = new FFI(
    "int printf(const char *format, ...);", // this is regular C declaration
    "libc.so.6");
// call C printf()
$ffi->printf("Hello %s!\n", "world");
</code>

==== Calling a function, returning structure through argument ====
<code php>
<?php
// create gettimeofday() binding
$ffi = new FFI("
    typedef unsigned int time_t;
    typedef unsigned int suseconds_t;

    struct timeval {
        time_t      tv_sec;
        suseconds_t tv_usec;
    };

    struct timezone {
        int tz_minuteswest;
        int tz_dsttime;
    };

    int gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv, struct timezone *tz);    
", "libc.so.6");
// create C data structures
$tv = $ffi->new("struct timeval");
$tz = $ffi->new("struct timezone");
// calls C gettimeofday()
var_dump($ffi->gettimeofday(FFI::addr($tv), FFI::addr($tz)));
// access field of C data structure
var_dump($tv->tv_sec);
// print the whole C data structure
var_dump($tz);
</code>

==== Accessing C variables ====
<code php>
<?php
// create FFI object, loading libc and exporting errno variable
$ffi = new FFI("int errno;", // this is regular C declaration
    "libc.so.6");
// print C errno
var_dump($ffi->errno);
</code>

==== Working with C arrays ====
<code php>
<?php
// create C data structure
$a = FFI::new("unsigned char[1024*1024]"); // "FFI::new" is different from "new FFI"
// work with it like with regular PHP array
for ($i = 0; $i < count($a); $i++) {
  $a[$i] = $i;
}
var_dump($a[25]);
$sum = 0;
foreach ($a as $n) {
  $sum += $n;
}
var_dump($sum);
var_dump(FFI::sizeof($a));
</code>


===== PHP FFI API =====
==== FFI::__construct([string $cdef = "" [, string $lib = null]]) ====

Creates a new FFI object. The first optional argument is a string, containing a sequence of declarations in regular C languages (types, structures, functions, variables, etc). Actually, this string may be copy-pasted from C header files. The second optional argument is a shared library file name, to be loaded and linked with definitions. All the declared entities are going to be available to PHP through overloaded functions or other FFI API functions:

  * C variables may be accessed as FFI object properties
  * C functions may called as FFI object methods
  * C type names may be used to create new C data structures using **FFI::new**, **FFI::type**, etc 

Note: We don't support C preprocessor, yet. #include, #define and CPP macros don't work. 

==== FFI::new(mixed $type [, bool $own = true [, bool $persistent = false]]): FFI\CData ====

Creates native data structure of given C type. $type may be any valid C string declaration or an instance of **FFI\CType** created before. Using the second argument, it's possible to create **owned** data (default), or unmanaged. In first case, data structure is going to leave together with returned FFI\CData object, and die when last reference is released by regular PHP reference counting or GC. However, in some cases, programmer may decide to keep C data even after, releasing of **FFI\CData** object and manually free it through **FFI::free()** similar to regular C. By default, the memory for the data is allocated on PHP request heap (using emalloc()), but it's also possible to use system heap, specifying true in the third argument.

This function may be called statically and use only predefined C type names (e.g int, char, etc), or as a method or previusly created **FFI** object. In last case, it may reuse any types declared in constructor.

The returned **FF\CData** object may be used in a number of ways as a regular PHP data
  * C data of scalar types may be read and assigned as regular PHP data. **''$x = FFI::new("int"); $x = 42;''**
  * C struct/union field may be accessed as regular PHP object properties. **''$cdata->field''**
  * C array elements may be accessed as regular PHP array elements. **''$cdata[$offset]''**
  * C array may be iterated using **foreach** statement.
  * C array may be used as arguments to **count()** function.
  * C pointers may be dereferenced as arrays. **''$cdata[0]''**
  * C pointers may be compared using regualar comparison operators (<, <=, ==, !==, >=, >).
  * C pointers may be increment/decrement using regular +/-/++/-- operation. **''$cdata += 5''**
  * C pointers may be subtracted one from another using regular **-** operation.
  * C pointer to function may be called as a regular PHP closure. **''$cdata()''**
  * Any C data may be visualized using **var_dump()**, **print_r()**, etc.
  * It's possible to pass PHP functions as C callbacks

  * **isset()**, **empty()** and **unset()** functions don't work with CData
  * **foreach** statement doesn't work with C struct/union

==== FFI::free(FFI\CData $cdata): void ====

Manually releases previously created "not-owned" data structure.

==== FFI::cast(mixed $type, FFI\CData $cdata): FFI\CData ====

Performs C type cast. It creates a new **FFI\CData** object, that references the same C data structure, but using different type. The resulting object doesn't own the C data, and the source $cdata must relive the result. C type mat be specified as any valid C type declaration string or **FFI\CType** object, created before.

This function may be called statically and use only predefined C type names (e.g int, char, etc), or as a method or previusly created **FFI** object. In last case, it may reuse any types declared in constructor.

==== FFI::addr(FFI\CData $cdata): FFI\CData ====

Creates a not owned pointer to the C data represented by given **FFI\CData**. The source $data must relive the resulting pointer. This function is mainly useful to pass arguments of C functions by pointer.

==== FFI::type(string $type): FFI\CType ====

This function creates and returns a FFI\CType object, representng type of the given C type declaration string.

This function may be called statically and use only predefined C type names (e.g int, char, etc), or as a method or previusly created **FFI** object. In last case, it may reuse any types declared in constructor.

==== FFI::array_type(FFI\CType $type, array $dims): FFI\CType ====

Dynamically constructs a new C array type with elements of type defined by the first argument and dimensions specified by the second. In the following example $t1 and $t2 are equivalent array types.

<code php>
$t1 = FFI::type("int[2][3]");
$t2 = FFI::array_type(FFI::type("int"), [2, 3]);
</code>

==== FFI::typeof(FFI\CData $data): FFI\CType ====

This function returns a **FFI\CType** object, representing the type of the given **FFI\CData** object.

==== FFI::sizeof(mixed $cdata_or_ctype): int ====

Returns size of the given **FFI\CData** or **FFI\CType**

==== FFI::alignof(mixed $cdata_or_ctype): int ====

Returns size of the given **FFI\CData** or **FFI\CType**

==== FFI::memcpy(FFI\CData $dst, mixed $src, int $size): void ====

Copies $size bytes from memory area $src to memory area $dst. $src may be any native data structure (**FFI\CData**) or PHP **string**.

==== FFI::memcmp(mixed $src1, mixed $src2, int $size): int ====

Compares $size bytes from memory area $src1 and $dst2. Both $src1 and $src2 may be any native data structures (**FFI\CData**) or PHP **string**s.

==== FFI::memset(FFI\CData $dst, int $c, int $size): void ====

Fills the $size bytes of the memory area pointed to by $dst with the constant byte $c

==== FFI::string(FFI\CData $src [, int $size]): string ====

Creates a PHP string from $size bytes of memory area pointed by $src. If size is omitted, $src must be zero terminated array of C chars.

==== FFI::load(string $file_name): FFI ====

In addition to ability of embedding C declaration code into C constructor, it's also possible to load C declarations from separate C header file.

Note: We don't support C preprocessor, yet. #include, #define and CPP macros don't work. 

It's possible to specify shared libraries, that should be loaded, using special **FFI_LIB** define in the loaded C header file.

FFI definition parsing and shared library loading may take significant time. It's not useful to do it on each HTTP request in WEB environment. However, it's possible to pre-load FFI definitions and libraries at php startup, and instantiate FFI objects when necessary. Header files may be extended with special **FFI_SCOPE** define (default pre-loading scope is "C") and then loaded by **FFI::load()** during preloading. This leads to creation of persistent binding, that will available to all the following requests through **FFI::scope()**.

It's possible to preload few C header files within same scope.

==== FFI::scope(string $scope_name): FFI ====

This function may be used to instantiate **FFI** object, containing C declarations parsed during preloading.

===== PHP FFI Performance =====

...

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None, except of introduced **FFI** class and namespace.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.4

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Opcache ====
FFI is designed in conjunction with preloading (curently implemented as part of opcache). FFI C headers may be loaded during preloading by **FFI::load()** and become available to all the following HTTP requests without reloading overhead. 

==== php.ini Defaults ====
  ffi.enable=false|preload|true 

allows enabling or disabling FFI API usage, or restricting it only to preloaded files. The default value is **preload**

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Future Scope =====
Currently, the performance of C data structures access is worst, then access of native PHP data structures (arrays and objects). This is a common problem of LuaJIT (in interpretator mode) and Python as well. However, LuaJIT may also compile these access code in very efficient way (almost as C compiler), and produce highly efficient machine code. It's planned to try similar things, implementing JIT for PHP.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Include FFI extension into PHP-7.4
This project requires 50%+1 majority
