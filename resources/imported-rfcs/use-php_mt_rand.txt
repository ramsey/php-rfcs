====== PHP RFC: Use php_mt_rand() instead of php_rand() ======
  * Version: 0.9

  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/use-php_mt_rand

https://wiki.php.net/rfc/rng_fixes tooke care of this RFC. Withdrawn.

===== Introduction =====
Both php_rand() and php_mt_rand() internal function provides pseudo random numbers. php_rand() uses system random function which has less randomness compare to MT rand. There are few places that use php_rand() currently.

  * http://lxr.php.net/search?q=php_rand&defs=&refs=&path=&hist=&project=PHP_5_5

These functions could use php_mt_rand() instead of php_rand() to improve randomness.

  * Most system uses random() function that has cycle of 16 * ((2^31) - 1)
  * MT rand has cycle of 2^19937-1 which is much larger than random().


===== Proposal =====

  - Add automatic seeding to php_mt_rand() like php_rand() currently is.
  - Use php_mt_rand() where php_rand() is used.
  - Add 64 bit MT rand for 64 bit platforms. http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt64.html
  - Use php_mt_rand()/php_mt_srand() for rand()/srand() PHP function.
  - Rename rand()/srand() to rand_XXX()/srand_XXX() - name is TBD.

Note: rand() (or rand_XXX) uses php_rand(), NOT php_mt_rand().

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Game that expects the same pseudo random sequences. These apps may use mt_srand() to get fixed random 
sequences and adjust their apps if it is needed.

64 bit platforms get different pseudo random sequences. 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

  * PHP 5.x+

===== Open Issues =====
Determine rand() rename candidate.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
php_rand()/php_srand() remains. Therefore, modules that are using them are not affected.

===== Future Scope =====
None.
