====== PHP RFC: Closure self reference ======
  * Version: 0.2
  * Date: 2020-11-10
  * Author: Danack
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closure_self_reference

===== Introduction =====

Currently, the main way used to call a closure from within that closure, is to bind a variable by reference into the closure, when the closure is created.

However this can lead to shenanigans:

<code php>
$fibonacci = function (int $n) use (&$fibonacci) {
    if ($n === 0) return 0;
    if ($n === 1) return 1;
    return $fibonacci($n-1) + $fibonacci($n-2);
};

echo $fibonacci(10). "\n";
$this_is_the_original_fibonacci = $fibonacci;
// ... many lines of code here
$fibonacci = function (int $n) { return rand(0, $n); };
// ... many lines of code here

echo $this_is_the_original_fibonacci(10). "\n";
</code>

i.e. a change to the variable outside the closure has modified the behaviour of the closure. That a closure can change behaviour like this violates the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment|Principle of least astonishment]]

===== Proposal =====

Allow closures to be aliased to a variable that can be used within the closure:

<code php>
$fibonacci = function (int $n) as $fibonacci {
    if ($n === 0) return 0;
    if ($n === 1) return 1;
    return $fibonacci($n-1) + $fibonacci($n-2);
};
</code>
