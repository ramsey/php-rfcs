===== Introduction =====

PHP 5 introduced the concept of autoloading classes.

However, many different projects adopted their own approach for class loader. In the mid of 2009, several lead developers started an initiative called PHP Standards Group, which is mainly focused on interoperability between Open Source projects.

After a couple of months of discussions, this group came with what they called as PSR-0 or PHP Standards Recommendation #0.

The intention of this document is to deliver a flexible autoloader that could be used by all projects, providing a more organized way to develop any application.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

The proposal and PHP implementation is already available anywhere through: [[http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/psr-0-final-proposal]]
Main purpose of this proposal is to suport both PEAR style directory organization and also Namespace directory organization.

A C extension is already available for usage, and can be grabbed at [[http://github.com/metagoto/splclassloader]]

===== Changelog =====

2010-03-22 Guilherme Blanco: Initial RFC creation.
