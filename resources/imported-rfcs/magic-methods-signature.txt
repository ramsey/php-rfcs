====== PHP RFC:  Ensure correct magic methods' signatures when typed ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2020-04-05
  * Author: Gabriel Caruso (<carusogabriel@php.net>)
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Target Version: PHP 8.0
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4177

===== Introduction =====

This RFC is inspired by [[https://bugs.php.net/69718|a bug report]] that lists magic methods in PHP that do not have any checks at all to their signature when typed.

However, this implementation is not as simple as just check for the methods' signatures, as this is a Backward Incompatible Change for those who have incorrect signatures over their codebases.

Nowadays, PHP already checks the signature for the following methods:

  * //%%__%%clone// return type: https://3v4l.org/Ub54p
  * //%%__%%construct// return type: https://3v4l.org/CCL11
  * //%%__%%destruct// return type: https://3v4l.org/HNkgW
  * //%%__%%toString// return type: https://3v4l.org/jIg7b/rfc#git-php-master

===== Motivation =====

Since the introduction of types in PHP 7.0, only the 3 checks listed above were introduced to make sure that developers are using PHP's magic methods correctly.

For PHP 8, this RFC aims to expand these checks, making their usage standard across different projects and applications.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to introduce the following signatures checks when magic methods are typed. 

**Important:** only, and only if, any of the listed magic methods use type hints and/or return types, these checks will be performed. In case they don't have types declared, nothing specific will happen.

The proposal follows the [[https://php.net/oop5.magic|Magic Methods documentation]].

<code php>
/** @return mixed */
Foo::__call(string $name, array $arguments);

/** @return mixed */
Foo::__callStatic(string $name, array $arguments);

Foo::__clone(): void;

Foo::__debugInfo(): array;

/** @return mixed */
Foo::__get(string $name);

Foo::__isset(string $name): bool;

Foo::__serialize(): array;

/** @param mixed $value */
Foo::__set(string $name, $value): void;

Foo::__unserialize(array $data): void;

Foo::__unset(string $name): void;
</code>

**Note:** The //%%__%%construct// and //%%__%%destruct// methods won't suffer any change. They won't allow //void// as a return type given the fact that (almost) all languages, including PHP, have the concept of Constructors and Destructors "returning" something after their execution. 
  
===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

An important note here is that if one of the listed magic methods is directly called, and it has the wrong signatures, the error will be thrown regardless.

For example https://3v4l.org/CuTNm, after this RFC, the errors about incorrect signatures will be thrown.

==== To Magic Methods without types declared ====

None.

==== To Magic Methods with the wrong signatures ====

Magic methods' signatures not matching the ones listed above, an error will be thrown, a //Fatal Error// more specific, following the errors of the same kind that are placed today.

===== RFC Impact =====

Scraping the top 1000 Composer packages (using Nikita's [[https://gist.github.com/nikic/a2bfa3e2f604f66115c3e4b8963a6c72|script]]), [[https://gist.github.com/carusogabriel/e0b36e7cd9e6846e04f79008cb7e35d6|the results]] show only 7 occurrences of not matching signatures. 

Luckily, none of them is a problem as //%%__%%call//, //%%__%%callStatic// and //%%__%%get// do not have checks at this time. 

Even with a //mixed// RFC that wouldn't be a problem, as [[https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/ad7e93a023a9/Zend/tests/type_declarations/mixed/inheritance/mixed_return_inheritance_success2.phpt|a specific type can override it]], by the Liskov Substitution Principle.

===== Future Scope =====

This RFC only aims to add checks for the methods' signatures but as a Future Scope, a runtime check of what is been returning in the methods could be added, same as //%%__%%serialize// (https://3v4l.org/HLiTj) and //%%__%%toString// (https://3v4l.org/Dbe6G).

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
