====== PHP RFC:  Ensure correct magic methods' signatures when typed ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2020-04-05
  * Author: Gabriel Caruso (<carusogabriel@php.net>)
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Target Version: PHP 8.0
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4177

===== Introduction =====

This RFC is inspired by [[https://bugs.php.net/69718|a bug report]] that lists magic methods in PHP that do not have any checks at all to their signature when typed.

However, this implementation is not as simple as just check for the methods' signatures, as this is a Backward Incompatible Change for those who have incorrect signatures over their codebases.

Nowadays, PHP already checks the signature for the following methods:

  * clone return type: https://3v4l.org/Ub54p
  * construct return type: https://3v4l.org/CCL11
  * destruct return type: https://3v4l.org/HNkgW

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to introduce the following signatures checks when magic methods are typed:

<code php>
/** @return mixed */
Foo::__call(string $name, array $arguments);

/** @return mixed */
Foo::__callStatic(string $name, array $arguments);

Foo::__clone(): void;

/** @param mixed $args */
Foo::__construct($args): void;

Foo::__destruct(): void;

/** @return mixed */
Foo::__get(string $name);

Foo::__isset(string $name): bool;

/** @param mixed $value */
Foo::__set(string $name, $value): void;

Foo::__unset(string $name): void;
</code>

This follows the [[https://php.net/oop5.magic|Magic Methods documentation]].
  
===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Magic methods' signatures not matching the ones listed above will throw an error.

===== Future Scope =====

This RFC only aims to add checks for the methods' signatures but as a Future Scope, a runtime check of what is been returning in the methods could be added, same as //%%__serialize%%// (https://3v4l.org/HLiTj) and //%%__toString%%// (https://3v4l.org/Dbe6G).

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Yes/No.
