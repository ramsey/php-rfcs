===== Introduction =====

Keeping HTTP session as secure as possible is what the session manager's task. **Session manager can improve HTTP session security without user code modification while keeping compatibility with existing applications.**

session_regenerate_id() is used to generate new session ID. It better to delete old session data to reduce risk of session hijack. Currently session_regenerate_id() leave old session data by default. Old session data is active and usable until GC. 

Old session is left for reliable session ID regeneration. There are many reasons why old session is left. Browsers connect to web server with multiple connection. Mobile network may lost radio, may have hand over, etc. Large network providers have multiple gateways to off load traffic and packets may arrive out of order.


Leaving old session opens window to attacker widely:
  - Old session lives long term and never expires if there is access to it. i.e. Attacker may access periodically
  - There is no mechanism to detect possibles attack even if session manager may detect attacks.

Counter measure for session hijack: Requirement - Session ID regeneration must be reliable.
  - Make sure old session is deleted certain period.
  - Raise error/exception for invalid access. (Raise error for should be deleted session access)

Problem of immediate old session deletion:
  - Make session ID regeneration unreliable.
  - Remove alarm for possible attacks.

**"Make sure old session is deleted certain period"** and **"Raise error/exception for invalid access"** provides much better security than current.


===== Proposal =====

==== Add __SESSION_REGENERATE_ID_EXPIRE__ time stamp ====

**"Make sure old session is deleted certain period"** can be achieved by time stamp in session data. When session_regenerate_id() called, session manager sets

  $_SESSION['__SESSION_REGENERATE_ID_EXPIRE__'] = time() + ini_get('session.regenerate_id_expire');

When session manager initializes session, check above value. If expired session is accessed, session manager raises "SessionExpiredAccessException".



===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

  * If user script has __SESSION_REGENERATE_ID_EXPIRE__ key in $_SESSION, it may break application.
  * Raised exception may break application.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 5.X+


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

  * Add __SESSION_REGENERATE_ID_EXPIRE__ time stamp Yes/No
