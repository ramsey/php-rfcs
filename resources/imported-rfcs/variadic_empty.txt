===== Introduction =====
This RFC aims to enable ''empty()'' to accept any number of arguments.

<code php>
// example current usage #1:
if (empty($a) || empty($b) || empty($c)) {}

// example current usage #2:
if (!empty($a) && !empty($b) && !empty($c)) {}

// new proposed usage #1:
if (empty($a, $b, $c)) {}

// new proposed usage #2:
if (!empty($a, $b, $c)) {}
</code>

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to change ''empty()'' so that it has a variable arity. This will enable developers to write more compact code when checking for the emptiness of multiple expressions.

As the above snippet demonstrates, the semantics of a variadic ''empty()'' should be the equivalent to logically OR'ing together multiple ''empty()'' invocations. Thus, if //any// arguments passed into ''empty()'' are considered falsy, then **true** will be returned - otherwise, **false** is returned. This behaviour seems to be the most prevalent usage of multiple empty checks in a condition, therefore benefitting the most end users.

===== Justification =====

In PHP, it is not uncommon to see conditionals consisting of multiple ''empty()'' invocations. This is evident by simply browsing through some popular open source projects:

WordPress (( https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-admin/includes/template.php#L1963 )):
<code php>
if ( empty( $pointer_id ) || empty( $selector ) || empty( $args ) || empty( $args['content'] ) )
</code>
OpenCart (( https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/45fc863fa068d82b5280890e6466a198faa54bff/upload/admin/controller/openbay/ebay_profile.php#L128 )):
<code php>
if (empty($setting['dispatch_times']) || empty($setting['countries']) || empty($setting['returns'])){
</code>
phpBB (( https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb/blob/040d451dcca9ae54d8f4b7bdd2f231033765a8f2/phpBB/phpbb/notification/method/jabber.php#L48 )):
<code php>
return !(
			empty($this->config['jab_enable']) ||
			empty($this->config['jab_host']) ||
			empty($this->config['jab_username']) ||
			empty($this->config['jab_password']) ||
			!@extension_loaded('xml')
		);
</code>

And so on...

So this seems like quite a common need for users, and one that cannot be emulated in user-land code because of ''empty()'''s behaviour of suppressing undefined variables. Also, it will make ''empty()'' more inline with the not-too-disimillar ''isset()'', which is good for the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment|Principle of Least Astonishment]] (mainly aimed at neophyte developers).

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
No BC breakages.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.0

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
The current functionality of ''empty()'' will be completely preserved.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Because this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required.

===== Patches and Tests =====
