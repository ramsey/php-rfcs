====== PHP RFC: Catching Multiple Exception Types ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2016-03-06

===== Introduction =====

When two different types of exceptions are handled the same way, it is sometimes required to duplicate code of the catch statements.

For example : 

<code php>
<?php

try {
   // Some code...
} catch (ExceptionType1 $e) {
   // Code to handle the exception
} catch (ExceptionType2 $e) {
   // Same code to handle the exception
} catch (Exception $e) {
   // ...
}
</code>

A solution to fix this problem on the user level would be to implement a common interface for ExceptionType1 and ExceptionType2 and catch it. However, this is only possible when you control the exception hierarchy in your own code, but not possible when you don't control the code.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC introduce the possibility to catch multiple exceptions types in a single catch statement to avoid code duplication.

<code php>
<?php

try {
   // Some code...
} catch (ExceptionType1 | ExceptionType2 $e) {
   // Code to handle the exception
} catch (\Exception $e) {
   // ...
}
</code>

This syntax and functionality is compatible with the Union types RFC proposed here : https://wiki.php.net/rfc/union_types
