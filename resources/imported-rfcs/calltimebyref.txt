===== Introduction =====

This RFC aims to clarify the situation with call-time pass-by-ref in PHP 5.3.



===== History =====

Before PHP 4.0 was released, ''allow_call_time_pass_reference'' was introduced as a means of retaining back compatibility with PHP 3, at the point where returning by reference from a function declaration became possible [1]. By default, the INI switch has been On since inception [2]. The warning (formerly ''E_COMPILE_WARNING'' but currently ''E_DEPRECATED'') is only thrown if the INI switch is Off. You therefore need to **explicitly** switch off the directive in order to discover that the behaviour is deprecated.

At the time ''allow_call_time_pass_reference'' was introduced, php.ini-recommended was interestingly referred to as 'php.ini-optimized'. Over the years, it has become fairly standard to regard php.ini-recommended as 'production settings'; things like ''display_errors=Off'' and ''log_errors=On'' have helped this perception along. For the last 8 years, therefore, the first anyone is likely to have known about their code being less than kosher is when it went live.

Even in the current php.ini-recommended, the switch is attributed only to 'Code cleanliness'. The full entry in the heading about changed settings reads:

<code>
; - allow_call_time_pass_reference = Off     [Code cleanliness]
;     It's not possible to decide to force a variable to be passed by reference
;     when calling a function.  The PHP 4 [sic] style to do this is by making the
;     function require the relevant argument by reference.
</code>

In fact, allowing values to be passed by reference is the default behaviour in PHP, and has been from PHP 4.0 beta right up to PHP 5.3.

===== Reality Check =====

In some circumstances, on some platforms, returning values by reference can actually speed up your code. In most cases, though - and for all when it comes to large arrays - it carries a performance penalty. If you make use of by-ref for performance reasons on a given platform, that optimization will not be portable.

===== Future =====

The directive is completely gone from CVS HEAD [3]. The effect of this originally was that a new-to-many ''E_STRICT'' would be thrown when values are returned by reference. However, it's been moved to ''E_DEPRECATED'' recently. In either case, it will no longer be possible to turn the warning off.

===== Proposal =====

Switch ''allow_call_time_pass_reference'' off by default in PHP_5_3 branch. At present there is no warning when running PHP under default settings, whereas in PHP 6 there will be a 'deprecated' warning given and no means of turning it off.
