====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2020-05-25
  * Author: Max Semenik, maxsem.wiki@gmail.com
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces

===== Introduction =====
PHP errors, unlike exceptions, are much more limited in programmers' ability to control their handling and get detailed information about them. I propose to fix some of these issues by recording a backtrace for every error.

This can't be addressed with ''set_error_handler()'' and ''register_shutdown_function()'', the former can't handle certain types of errors while the latter is getting called when the original backtrace is already unavailable.

===== Proposal =====
Introduce a new INI setting, ''debug_backtraces'' that allows to turn this feature on and off, as well as to limit the number of stack frames outputted. Zero would mean no backtraces, a positive value means output this number of frames, negative value for no limit. By default it would be on in development settings but off in production. People who don't want to have the overhead of generating backtraces in production or who are afraid for stability can disable this functionality.

**Error output**: traces will be formatted exactly like for exceptions, and appended to error messages, e.g.:
<code>
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted in /var/www/test.php on line 123
#0 /var/www/test.php(123): spl_eat_all_memory()
#1 /var/www/foo.php(456): foo(123, 'foo')
#2 /var/www/bar.php(789): bar()
#3 {main}
</code>

**''error_get_last()''** output will have another element added to it if a trace is available:
<code>
#1 {main}
array(5) {
  ["type"]=>
  int(1)
  ["message"]=>
  string(22) "Error, terrible error!"
  ["file"]=>
  string(17) "/var/www/test.php"
  ["line"]=>
  int(3)
  ["backtrace"]=>
  string(123) "#0 /var/www/test.php(345): $this->causeTerribleError()
#1 {main}"
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Everything will behave exactly as before with backtraces disabled, while turning them on would introduce a few minor changes to how errors are represented. Should not be a problem. In the current proposed implementation, a new error constant ''E_UNHANDLED_EXCEPTION'' is introduced, though it's not included in ''E_ALL'' and is for internal use only.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
8.0

==== php.ini Defaults ====
For ''error_backtraces'':
  * Default value: 0
  * php.ini-development value: 100
  * php.ini-production value: 0

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Everything other the minor stuff mentioned in //Backward Incompatible Changes//.

===== Future Scope =====
Backtrace handling code could use some unification and refactoring, but that doesn't require a RFC and thus can be addressed later.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Accept this RFC (yes/no)?
