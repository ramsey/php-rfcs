===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes to make the hash extension (`ext/hash`) always available, similar to the ''date'', `spl` & `pcre` extensions.

===== Proposal =====
The hash extension provides a very rich utility with many hashing algorithms which is extremely useful in modern day applications, not only in userland code but also very much in internals.

After a recent discussion on Github[1], Johannes proposed that the hash extension should be treated as special extension which cannot be disabled.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Build configurations that contain `--enable-hash` will have to be updated, as the argument will cease to exists. The `--with-mhash` argument will continue to stay.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Target PHP version is the next master, which at the time of writing is most likely 7.4.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs and Existing Extensions ====

The only impact on SAPIs, Extensions and PECL extensions is that they can now always rely on the `hash` extension to be available and utilize its API without having external dependencies for such.

This naturally also means that minimal builds of PHP will slightly grow in size.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Any already existing userland code will continue to work as before. Userland may remove calls to `extension_loaded('hash')` as they will now always return true.

The hash extension does not have any external dependencies, so this will not add any more dependencies for a minimal build of PHP.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Since this touches a major component in the php-src source, the voting will require a 2/3 majority to pass.

===== Patches and Tests =====

If the voting passes, a patch to alter the extension build configurations for Windows and Unix will be committed.
