====== PHP RFC: Safe Casting Functions ======

===== Introduction =====

Currently, PHP only provides one means of type conversion: explicit casts. These casts never fail or emit errors, making them dangerous to use, as when passed garbage input, they will simply return garbage instead of indicating that something went wrong. This makes it difficult to write robust applications which handle user data. They also prevent any suggestion of strict type hinting for scalar types, because if that were to be added, users would simply use dangerous explicit casts to get around errors and the result would be code that is buggier than it would have been without type hinting at all.

===== Proposal =====

A set of three "safe casting" functions for converting to types is is added to ''ext/standard'': ''to_int()'', ''to_float()'' and ''to_string()''. These functions validate their input instead of casting blindly. If the input fails to validate, they return FALSE. (Returning ''FALSE'' is controversial, however, so while this is my preferred option and is the one implemented, it will be put to a vote.)

''to_int()'' accepts only ints, non-NaN integral floats within the range of an integer (''PHP_INT_MIN'' to ''PHP_INT_MAX''), and strings containing decimal integer sequences within the range of an integer. Leading and trailing whitespace is not permitted.

''to_float()'' accepts only ints, floats, and strings representing floats. Leading and trailing whitespace is not permitted.

''to_string()'' accepts only strings, and objects which cast to strings.

==== Rationale ====

The concept was developed in my thoughts, and in discussions with Anthony Ferrara (both in-person at PHPNW14 and online) and others in [[http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php|StackOverflow's PHP chatroom]]. Here, I list some of my or our rationale for particular decisions.

  * Whitespace is rejected because it is much simpler to manually strip it (''to_int(trim(...))'') than it is to manually reject it, and accepting it makes it less useful to people who want very strict validation
  * ''"10.0"'' and similar float-like strings are not accepted by ''to_int()'' as we agreed that allowing ''http://example.com/foo.php?id=10.0'' (for example) didn't seem right, the canonical string representation of a float does not have a trailing ''.0'', and it is trivial to just chain the functions like so: ''to_int(to_float(...))''
  * NaN is not accepted for ''to_int()'' because it is usually an error value produced if something goes wrong
  * Floats passed to ''to_int()'' that are outside the range of an integer are rejected rather than overflowing because both saturating (i.e. capping at _MAX or _MIN) or truncating (wrapping around/modulo) are non-intuitive behaviours and both lead to data loss
  * Trailing non-numeric characters are rejected by ''to_int()'' and ''to_float()'' because this causes data loss
  * The functions return ''FALSE'' on failure instead of ''NULL'' because:
      * If strict type hinting were added, they would fail for a nullable typehint
      * ''FALSE'' is a traditional error value in PHP
      * ''NULL'' is used to signify the absence of a value - but what we want to signify is an invalid value (similar to 0 vs NaN)
  * An error return value was chosen instead of an exception:
      * To make chaining easier, and because checking for FALSE is easier than checking if an exception was thrown (''if ($value === FALSE) { ... } else { ... }'' vs ''try { ... } catch (Exception $e) { $errored = true; ... } if (!$errored) { ... }'')
      * Exceptions are currently not used in core functions
      * The cast failing is not an exceptional case, as it is a validation function, so it should use a return value, not an exception 

==== Examples Table ====

A sample table of whether values pass or fail generated by [[https://gist.github.com/TazeTSchnitzel/19c91f800e47d53cc28c|this script]], on a 64-bit machine:

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This is proposed for the next major version of PHP, currently PHP 7.

===== Open Issues =====

Nikita Popov has suggested not allowing trailing and leading whitespace here. After all, the user can always use ''trim'' first.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

This does not touch the explicit cast operators (''(int)'', ''(float)'', ''(string)'' etc.) nor the explicit cast functions (''intval()'', ''floatval'', ''strval()'' etc.).

===== Future Scope =====

This might be extended to other types. However, support for the other scalar types has deliberately not been included. For booleans, there is no clear single format to accept, and it is very simple to do so manually. NULL is a type with only one possible value, so there is no point in casting. Resources are special and don't really count as scalars.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As this is not a language change and only introduces new functions, only a 50%+1 majority will be required. The vote will be a straight Yes/No vote on accepting the RFC and merging the patch into master.

Because the behaviour on the error case is controversial, a second three-way simple majority vote will be held at the same time, with the options being return ''NULL'', return ''FALSE'' and throw an exception.

===== Patches and Tests =====

I have made a patch and pull request on GitHub against the master branch: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/874

Theodore Brown has created a userland polyfill with the same behaviour: https://github.com/theodorejb/PolyCast

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====

Safer or stricter casts have been requested before:
