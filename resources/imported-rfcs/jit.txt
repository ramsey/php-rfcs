===== Introduction =====
It's no secret that the performance jump of PHP 7 was originally initiated by attempts to implement JIT for PHP. These efforts started by Dmitry in 2011 and since that time he tried 3 different implementations.  We never moved forward to propose to release any of them, for three main reasons:  They resulted in no substantial performance gains for typical Web apps;  They were complex to develop and maintain;  We still had additional directions we could explore to improve performance without having to use JIT.

===== The Case for JIT Today ====

Even though most of the fundamentals for JIT-enabling PHP haven't changed - we believe there is a good case today for JIT-enabling PHP.

First, we believe we've reached the extent of our ability to improve PHP's performance using other optimization strategies.  In other words - we can't further improve the performance of PHP unless we use JIT.

Secondly - using JIT may open the door for PHP being more frequently used in other, non-Web, CPU-intensive scenarios - where the performance benefits will actually be very substantial - and for which PHP is probably not even being considered today.

Lastly - making JIT available can provide us (with additional efforts) with the ability to develop built-in functions in PHP, instead of (or in addition to) C - without suffering the huge performance penalty that would be associated with such a strategy in today's, non-JITted engine.  This, in turn, can open the door to faster innovation - and also more secure implementations, that would be less susceptible to memory management, overflows and similar issues associated with C-based development.

===== Proposal =====
We propose to include JIT in PHP 8 and provide additional efforts to increase its performance and usability.

In addition, we propose to consider including JIT in PHP 7.4 as an experimental feature (disabled by default).

PHP JIT is implemented as an almost independent part of OPcache. It may be enabled/disabled at PHP compile time and at run-time.
When enabled, native code of PHP files is stored in an additional region of the OPcache shared memory and op_array->opcodes[].handler(s) keep pointers to the JIT-ed code. This approach doesn't require engine modification at all.

We use DynAsm (developed for LuaJIT project) for generation of native code. It's a very lightweight and advanced tool, but does assume good, and very low-level development knowledge of target assembler languages.  In the past we tried LLVM, but its code generation speed was almost 100 times slower, making it prohibitively expensive to use. Currently we support only x86 and x86_64 on POSIX platforms. Windows support should be relatively straightforward, but was (and still is) a low priority for us. DynAsm also supports ARM. ARM64, MIPS, MIPS64 and PPC, so in theory we should be able to support all of the platforms that are popular for PHP deployments (given enough efforts).


The quality of the JIT may be demonstrated on Mandelbrot benchmark published at https://gist.github.com/dstogov/12323ad13d3240aee8f1, where it improves performance more than 4 times (0.011 sec vs 0.046 sec on PHP 7.4).

<code php>
    function iterate($x,$y)
    {
        $cr = $y-0.5;
        $ci = $x;
        $zr = 0.0;
        $zi = 0.0;
        $i = 0;
        while (true) {
            $i++;
            $temp = $zr * $zi;
            $zr2 = $zr * $zr;
            $zi2 = $zi * $zi;
            $zr = $zr2 - $zi2 + $cr;
            $zi = $temp + $temp + $ci;
            if ($zi2 + $zr2 > BAILOUT)
                return $i;
            if ($i > MAX_ITERATIONS)
                return 0;
        }
    
    }

      * (1<<0) - print generated assembler cede
      * (1<<1) - print intermediate SSA form used for code generation
      * (1<<2) - register allocation information
      * (1<<4) - allow debugging JIT-ed code using GDB
      * (1<<5) - generate perf.map file to list JIt-ed functions in Linux perf report
      * (1<<6) - provide information about JIt-ed code for Linux Oprofile
      * (1<<7) - provide information about JIt-ed code for Intel VTune
      * (1<<8) - generate perf.dump file to show assembler code of JIT-ed functions in Linux perf peport

==== Performance ====
JIT makes bench.php more than two times faster: 0.140 sec vs 0.320 sec.  It is expected to make most CPU-intensive workloads run significantly faster.
However, like the previous attempts - it currently doesn't seem to significantly improve real-life apps like WordPress (with opcache.jit=1235 326 req/sec vs 315 req/sec).

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Future Scope =====
In PHP 8 we are going to improve JIT and perform optimized code generation after an initial profiling of hot functions. This would allow application of speculative optimizations and generation only the code that is really executed. It's also possible to do deeper integration of JIT with preloading and FFI, and perhaps a standardized way of developing (and providing) built-in functions that are written in PHP, and not just in C.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This project requires a 50%+1 majority.

<doodle title="Include JIT into PHP 8?" auth="user" voteType="single" closed="true">
   * Yes
   * No
</doodle>

As PHP 7.4 is already branched and its engine is not expected to be significantly changed (consequently requiring corresponding changes to the JIT implementation), we can also consider including JIT in PHP-7.4 as an experimental feature (disabled by default).
