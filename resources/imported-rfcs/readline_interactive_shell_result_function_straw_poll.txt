====== Straw poll: Interest in configurable callback to dump results of expressions in `php -a` ======

===== Introduction =====

Many REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loops) for other programming languages that I'm familiar with print a (possibly truncated) representation of the result of expressions, but PHP doesn't.
It would be useful to allow users to extend the functionality of the default interactive php shell (''php -a''), possibly with ''auto_prepend_file'' or through use of command wrappers/aliases, or after loading the shell.
Prior to this RFC, there was no way to extend the interactive php shell in this way.
(I've seen https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh mentioned as an alternative for ''php -a'' while investigating this, but that's a shell written from scratch, and doesn't have some functionality from ''php -a'' such as tolerance of fatal errors)

===== Proposal =====

This straw poll is mentioned to decide on what form https://wiki.php.net/rfc/readline_interactive_shell_result_function should take, and if it should continue to be worked on.

==== Proposed default result expression dumping implementation ====
One of the comments was that it would make more sense if it was added at the same time as a default implementation for rendering result expressions.

For the sake of discussion, the following default implementation is proposed.
var_dump() is proposed for arrays and objects because it properly represents references and cyclic data structures.

The proposed snippet would be to behave as if this snippet were evaluated before ''auto_prepend_file'' was run and any input was entered.

<code php>
readline_interactive_shell_result_function(
    function(string $code, $result) {
        if (!isset($result)) {
            return;
        }
        if (is_scalar($result)) {
            echo "=> " . var_export($result, true) . "\n";
        } else {
            echo "=> "; var_dump($result);
        }});
</code>

With this default implementation, an example interactive ''php -a'' session would have the following output.

<code php>
Interactive shell

php > 1+1;
=> 2
php > 0.5 * 2;
=> 1.0
php > namespace\MyClass::class;
=> 'MyClass'
php > fn()=>true;
=> object(Closure)#2 (0) {
}
php > $x = ["foo", "bar"];
=> array(2) {
  [0]=>
  string(3) "foo"
  [1]=>
  string(3) "bar"
}
php > asort($x);
=> true
php > $x;
=> array(2) {
  [1]=>
  string(3) "bar"
  [0]=>
  string(3) "foo"
}
php > json_encode($x);
=> '{"1":"bar","0":"foo"}'
php > unset($x);
php > function function_returning_void() { echo "in function_returning_void()\n"; }
php > function_returning_void();
in function_returning_void()
php > json_decode('{"key": "value"}');
=> object(stdClass)#2 (1) {
  ["key"]=>
  string(5) "value"
}
php > throw new RuntimeException("test");

Warning: Uncaught RuntimeException: test in php shell code:1
Stack trace:
#0 {main}
  thrown in php shell code on line 1
php > readline_interactive_shell_result_function(null);
php > 1+1; // no longer dumped
php > 
</code>

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

This is a multiple choice poll, fill out any acceptable options.
The proposed default uses var_export for scalars, nothing for
