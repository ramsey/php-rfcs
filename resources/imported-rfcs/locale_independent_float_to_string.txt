====== PHP RFC: Locale-independent float to string cast ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2020-03-11
  * Author: George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>, Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>
  * Target Version: PHP 8.0
  * Status: Draft
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5224

===== Introduction =====
PHP's float's string representation depends on the current locale as the decimal separator varies between locales. This can lead to subtle bugs in certain locales (notably the German, French, and Spanish ones) as the ''float'' to ''string'' cast won't yield the original value.

===== Proposal =====
Make PHP's float to string cast locale-independent, meaning it will always use the dot ''.'' decimal separator, in PHP 8.0. Apart from casting, the change would also extend to some functions in ext/standard that convert ''float''s to ''string''s:

<code php>

setlocale(LC_ALL, "de_DE");
$f = 3.14;

echo (string) $f;		// 3,14 => 3.14
echo strval($f);		// 3,14 => 3.14
var_dump($f);			// string(4) "3,14" => string(4) "3.14"
printf("%.2f\n", $f);		// 3,14 => 3.14
debug_zval_dump($f);		// float(3,14) => float(3.14)

echo var_export($f, true);	// remains 3.14
echo serialize($f);		// remains d:3.14
echo json_encode($f);		// remains 3.14

</code>

This issue has been raised multiple times over the years on the PHP Internals mailing list [1] [2] and as bug reports [3] [4] [5].

  * Although this double cast may seem nonsensical if we remain within PHP's boundaries, having a consistent string representation for floats is important. Such values may be sent to an external API using a protocol where everything is represented as strings, such as HTTP. Therefore, the external API might refuse these values as not well formed, or try to interpret as a numerical value by dropping everything past the decimal separator.
  * The behaviour is highly surprising and therefore does not follow the Principle of Least Astonishment. [6]
  * Float to string conversions cannot be optimized statically, which may lead to subtle bugs with regards to OpCache (e.g. bug 79317 [7])
 
===== Alternative Approaches =====
An alternative approach would be to deprecate <php>setlocale()</php> all together as this would, as a by-product, fix this issue.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Outputting floats as strings in locales which change the decimal separator will have a slightly different output. As this is only a cosmetic change, the benefits of having a consistent float to string conversion out-way the impact which may be caused by this change.

To retain the old behaviour users should use the <php>number_format()</php> function or Intl's <php>NumberFormatter</php> class to format the number in the desired way.

===== Future Scope =====
None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
The primary vote ("Make ''float'' to ''string'' casts always locale-independent?") requires 2/3 majority.
