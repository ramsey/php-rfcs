This RFC is a parody on shortsyntaxforarrays RFC.

===== Introduction =====

In some cases it is necessary that you have to declare a lot of functions. Especially when you work with classes and their methods, the function declaration tends to make the code looking ugly. If you take a look at other languages (Brainfuck, Brainfork, Feckfeck, Smallfuck, Ook! and Spoon), they don't have such syntax at all! It's all short and readable and easy to type! Maybe PHP should adopt this behaviour to make code more readable and maintainable. 
The purpose of RFCs are to work collaboratively towards a specification and finally an implementation of an idea.

Example code:

<code php>
function some_long_function_name($array_parameter_omg, $some_more)
{
 --here_be_dragons--
}
</code>

New short non-ugly easily readable example code:

<code php>
. .[., .].
.
 --...._.._......--
.
</code>
===== Syntax =====

We might just replace the current **function <name>(<parameters>) {<body>}** syntax with something shorter and better.
I'd personally propose to use dashes and dots for everything of the above. It's short and you can read it really fast.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

No patch is available yet. I'm working on it, though.

This functionality is already available with Prep: https://github.com/andreiz/prep/tree/master/examples/whitespace
