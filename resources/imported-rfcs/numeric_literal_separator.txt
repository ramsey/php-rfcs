  * Target version: PHP 7.4
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4165

===== Introduction =====

The human eye is not optimized for quickly parsing long sequences of
digits. Thus, a lack of visual separators makes it take longer to
read and debug code, and can lead to unintended mistakes.

<code php>
1000000000;   // Is this a billion? 100 million? 10 billion?
‪107925284.88;‬ // What scale or power of 10 is this?
</code>

Additionally, without a visual separator numeric literals fail
to convey any additional information, such as whether a financial
quantity is stored in cents:

<code php>
$discount = 13500; // Is this 13,500? Or 135, because it's in cents?
</code>

===== Proposal =====

Enable improved code readability by supporting an underscore in
numeric literals to visually separate groups of digits.

<code php>
$threshold = 1_000_000_000;  // a billion!
$testValue = ‪107_925_284.88; // scale is hundreds of millions
$discount = 135_00;          // $135, stored as cents
</code>

Underscore separators can be used in all numeric literal notations
supported by PHP:

<code php>
6.674_083e-11; // float
299_792_458;   // decimal
0xCAFE_F00D;   // hexadecimal
0b0101_1111;   // binary
0137_041;      // octal
</code>

==== Restrictions ====

The only restriction is that each underscore in a numeric literal
must be directly between two digits. This rule means that none of
the following usages are valid numeric literals:

<code php>
_100; // already a valid constant name

// these all produce "Parse error: syntax error":
100_;       // trailing
1__1;       // next to underscore
1_.0; 1._0; // next to decimal point
0x_123;     // next to x
0b_101;     // next to b
1_e2; 1e_2; // next to e
</code>

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Adding an underscore between digits in a numeric literal will not
change its value. The underscores are stripped out during the lexing
stage, so the runtime is not affected.

<code php>
var_dump(1_000_000); // int(1000000)
</code>

This RFC does not change the behavior of string to number
conversion. Numeric separators are intended to improve code
readability, not alter how input is processed.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Discussion =====

==== Use cases ====

Digit separators make possible the cognitive process of
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing|subitizing]]. That is,
accurately and confidently "telling at a glance" the number of digits,
rather than having to count them. This measurably lessens the time
to correctly read numbers longer than four digits.

Large numeric literals are commonly used for business logic
constants, unit test values, and performing data conversions.
For example:

Composer's retry delay when removing a file:

<code php>
usleep(350000); // without separator

usleep(350_000); // with separator
</code>

Conversion of an Active Directory timestamp (the number of
100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601) to a Unix timestamp:

<code php>
$time = (int) ($adTime / 10000000 - 11644473600); // without separator

$time = (int) ($adTime / 10_000_000 - 11_644_473_600); // with separator
</code>

Working with scientific constants:

<code php>
const ASTRONOMICAL_UNIT = 149597870700; // without separator

const ASTRONOMICAL_UNIT = 149_597_870_700; // with separator
</code>

Separating bytes in a binary or hex literal:

<code php>
0b01010100011010000110010101101111; // without separator

0b01010100_01101000_01100101_01101111; // with separator

0x42726F776E; // without separator

0x42_72_6F_77_6E; // with separator
</code>

==== Use cases to avoid ====

It may be tempting to use integers for storing data such as phone,
credit card, and social security numbers since these values appear
numeric. However, this is almost always a bad idea, since such
numbers often have prefixes and leading digits that are significant.

A good rule of thumb is that if it doesn't make sense to use
mathematical operators on a value (e.g. adding it, multiplying it,
etc.), then an integer probably isn't the best way to store it.

<code php>
// don't do this:
$phoneNumber = 345_6789;
$creditCard = 231_6547_9081_2543;
$socialSecurity = 111_11_1111;
</code>

==== Will it be harder to search for numbers? ====

A concern that has been raised is whether numeric literal separators
will make it more difficult to search for numbers, since the same
value can be written in more than one way.

This is already possible, however. The same number can be written in
binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal, or exponential notation. In
practice, this isn't problematic as long as a codebase is consistent.

Furthermore, separators can sometimes make it easier to find numbers.
To use an earlier example, 13_500 and 135_00 could be differentiated
in a find/replace. Another example would be separated bytes in a hex
literal, which allows searching for a value like "_6F_" to find only
the numbers containing that specific byte.

==== Should it be the role of an IDE to group digits? ====

It has been suggested that numeric literal separators aren't needed
for better readability, since IDEs could be updated to automatically
display large numbers in groups of three digits.

However, it isn't always desirable to group numbers the same way.
For example, a programmer may write ''10050000'' differently
depending on whether or not it represents a financial quantity stored
as cents:

<code php>
$total = 100_500_00; // represents $100,500.00 stored as cents

$total = 10_050_000; // represents $10,050,000
</code>

Binary and hex literals may also be grouped by a varying number of
digits to reflect how they are used (e.g. bits may be separated into
nibbles, bytes, or words). An IDE cannot do this automatically
without knowing the programmer's intent for each numeric literal.

==== Why resurrect this proposal? ====

The [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/number_format_separator|previous RFC]]
was originally voted on over three years ago (January 2016). While a
majority of voters supported it, it did not reach the required 2/3
threshold for acceptance.

Based on reading the discussion at the time, it didn't receive enough
positive votes because there weren't many good use cases put forward
for it. Also, the RFC had a short voting period of only 1 week.

Since that time, the ability to use underscores in numeric literals
has been implemented in additional popular languages (e.g. Python,
JavaScript, and TypeScript), and a stronger case can be made for the
feature than was made before.

==== Should I vote for this feature? ====

Andrea Faulds summarized the considerations [[https://externals.io/email/90673/source|as follows]]:

<blockquote>
This feature offers some benefit in some cases. It doesn't introduce
much new complexity. There's no new syntax or tokens, it just modifies
the form of the existing number tokens. It fits in well [with] what's
already there, consistently applying to all number literals. It follows
established convention in other languages. Its appearance at least hints
that values with these separators are not constants or identifiers, but
numbers, reducing potential for confusion. It limits its own application
to prevent abuse (no leading, trailing, or repeated separators). And
it's relatively intuitive.
</blockquote>

==== Comparison to other languages ====
