====== PHP RFC: Batch Use Declarations ======
  * Date: 2015-01-28
  * Author: Márcio Almada, marcio.web2@gmail.com
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/batch_use_declarations
  * Patch: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1005

===== Introduction =====
This RFC represents an attempt to improve current PHP namespace implementation by introducing the concept of **Batch Use Declarations**:

<code php>
// Proposed batch use syntax:

use FooLibrary\Bar\Baz\Biz { ClassA, ClassB, ClassC as Fizbo, ClassD };

// Compared to current use syntax:

use FooLibrary\Bar\Baz\Biz\ClassA;
use FooLibrary\Bar\Baz\Biz\ClassB;
use FooLibrary\Bar\Baz\Biz\ClassC as Fizbo;
use FooLibrary\Bar\Baz\Biz\ClassD;
</code>

===== Proposal =====
Batch use declarations, also known as **grouped imports**, are just **syntax sugar** to cut verbosity when importing multiple entities from a common namespace. Using common PHP library examples, the following use declarations are equivalents:

<code php>
// Current use syntax:

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Expr\Comparison;
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Expr\Value;
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Expr\CompositeExpression;

// Proposed batch use syntax:

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Expr { Comparison, Value, CompositeExpression };
</code>

=== Compound Namespaces ===
Compound namespaces are also allowed. For instance, the following use declarations are equivalents:

<code php>
// Current use syntax:

use Symfony\Component\Console\Helper\Table;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\ArrayInput;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\NullOutput;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Question\Question;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Question\ChoiceQuestion as Choice;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Question\ConfirmationQuestion;

// Proposed batch use syntax:

use Symfony\Component\Console {
  Helper\Table,
  Input\ArrayInput,
  Input\InputInterface,
  Output\NullOutput,
  Output\OutputInterface,
  Question\Question,
  Question\ChoiceQuestion as Choice,
  Question\ConfirmationQuestion,
};
</code>

In case of doubt, this is a real use case. Check the Laravel source code:

  * [[https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5afdac39290bc38d729830190f17581b60b08502/src/Illuminate/Console/Command.php#L3-L10|https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Console/Command.php#L3-L10]]
  * [[https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5afdac39290bc38d729830190f17581b60b08502/src/Illuminate/Log/Writer.php#L5-L9|https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Log/Writer.php#L5-L9]]

=== Non Mixed Use Declarations ===
As expected, non mixed batch use declarations are supported:

<code php>
// Current use syntax:

use const foo\math\PI, foo\math\PI, foo\math\E, foo\math\GAMMA, foo\math\GOLDEN_RATIO;
use function foo\math\sin, foo\math\cos, foo\math\cosh;

// Proposed non mixed batch use syntax:

use function foo\math { sin, cos, cosh };
use const foo\math { PI, E, GAMMA, GOLDEN_RATIO };
</code>

=== Mixed Use Declarations ===
Current namespace implementation does not allow mixed imports of functions, constants and classes. With the approval of this RFC, for completeness, the following hypothetical mixed imports would be possible:

<code php>
// Current use syntax:

use const foo\math\PI;
use function foo\math\sin, foo\math\cos, foo\math\cosh
use foo\math\Math;

// Proposed mixed batch use syntax:

use foo\math { const PI, function sin, function cos, function cosh, Math };

</code>

===== About The Syntax Choice =====
The current choice for batch use syntax is basically a small variation from the current trait adaptation syntax:

<code php>
use A, B {
    B::smallTalk insteadof A;
    A::bigTalk insteadof B;
}
</code>

Such design choice allows the feature to stay familiar and intuitive to most PHP user base.

===== Optional: Nested Batch Use Declarations =====
**Nesting** would allow the following use case:

<code php>
use Symfony\Component\Console {
  Helper\Table,
  Input { ArrayInput, InputInterface }
  Output { NullOutput, OutputInterface },
  Question { Question, ChoiceQuestion, ConfirmationQuestion }
};
</code>

As the author of this RFC, I consider the **nesting** option **too complex** to be introduced. But since many people mentioned this **possibility**, it will be put into the discussion so the community has a chance to appoint.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There is no BC breaks with current implementation or feature concepts.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
This is proposed for the next PHP x, which at the time of this writing would be PHP 7. 

===== RFC Impact =====

=== On Backward Compatibility ===
This RFC is backwards compatible with previous PHP releases.

===== Open Issues =====
  * Should nested batch use declarations be allowed?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Original namespace implementation is not affected by the addition of batch use declarations. Current syntax would still be valid.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
As this RFC represents a language change a two third majority is required. 

===== Patches and Tests =====
The implementation aims to be minimal and of easy maintenance. I created a PR so that the patch diff can be viewed easily: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1005

The current initial implementation can be found on my PHP [[https://github.com/marcioAlmada/php-src/tree/batch-use|fork]]. You can also directly contribute to this RFC by sending a pull request to https://github.com/marcioAlmada/RFCs.

===== References =====
There is no found record related to batch use declarations on mailing lists.

==== Support in other languages ====
Other languages have similar ways to import multiple entities from a given package or module:

  * [[http://www.rust-lang.org|Rust Language]] has a very similar sintax `use a::b::{c,d,e,f};`
  * [[https://www.python.org|Pyhon]] has a different syntax but with the same objective: `from fibo import fib, fib2, fib3`

===== Rejected Features =====
Awaiting discussion.
