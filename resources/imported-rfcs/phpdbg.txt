===== Introduction =====

phpdbg is a gdb-like PHP debugger. Implemented as a SAPI module, it is intended to be installed alongside CLI and other SAPI modules.

Like CLI, and gdb, phpdbg is an executable intended to be executed at the terminal in an interactive way.

Much power is provided to the user in order to control and inspect execution as it occurs, breaking execution is supported in the following ways:

	phpdbg> break [file] test.php:1
	phpdbg> b [F] test.php:1
	Will break execution on line 1 of test.php

	phpdbg> break [func] my_function
	phpdbg> b [f] my_function
	Will break execution on entry to my_function

	phpdbg> break [method] \my\class::method
	phpdbg> b [m] \my\class::method
	Will break execution on entry to \my\class::method

	phpdbg> break [address] 0x7ff68f570e08
	phpdbg> b [a] 0x7ff68f570e08
	Will break at the opline with the address provided

	phpdbg> break [lineno] 200
	phpdbg> b [l] 200
	Will break at line 200 of the currently executing file

	phpdbg> break on ($expression == true)
	phpdbg> b on ($expression == true)
	Will break when the condition evaluates to true

	phpdbg> break op ZEND_ADD
	phpdbg> b O ZEND_ADD
	Will break on every occurence of the opcode provided

	phpdbg> break del 1
	phpdbg> b d 1

phpdbg has a step-through-each-opcode mode, whereby the interactive console is presented to the user after the execution of each individual opcode, and a few useful commands besides.

Disassembly of code is supported, providing tooling to inspect the internal structure of code in an effort to be a useful tool for pecl devs and php programmers.

Many more commands provide access to just about everything ...
    
Remote Debugging:

{{:rfc:java-example.png?600|}}

{{:rfc:java-example-big.png?600|}}

Remote Debugging is supported in unix by way of a protocol-free inetd like service, the Java client displayed is distributed with phpdbg, and is at least as comfortable as the command line, more so for some perhaps.

Much more information and documentation can be found on http://phpdbg.com
===== Proposal =====

phpdbg could (should) be included in the distribution in the /sapi folder, it makes no changes to any other SAPI.

The reason it should be included is, as a SAPI module, it is quite difficult to distribute phpdbg to a large audience.

The debugging environment is self contained within that executable, without requiring changes to any other binaries or libraries, with no need to share configurations it's installation is non-intrusive.

phpdbg can be merged into 5.6+ as it has already been patched, 5.5 would require a small change ... that boat has probably sailed ...
===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Nothing

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

ASAP

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

None

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

Opcache requires the following patch to support phpdbg: http://pastebin.com/caPW9tVx

Note: that list should be a blacklist, it's more forward compatible, the assumption that it doesn't work with new SAPI's is illogical.

This limitation, which may have an affect on userland software where php_sapi_name() is used, can be mitigated using the -S option to override the SAPI name.

Note that, overriding the SAPI name only changes the name as reported to the rest of the engine; //it does not use any of the structures from the SAPI requested//
===== New Constants =====

In phpdbg the constants:

  - PHPDBG_METHOD 
  - PHPDBG_FUNC
  - PHPDBG_LINENO 
  - PHPDBG_FILE 

are registered, they are only available when executing in phpdbg

===== php.ini Defaults =====

None

===== Open Issues =====

None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

All

===== Changes to PHP =====

No actual changes were required, a patch to export more of the Zend API was already merged into 5.6+

I'd quite like to introduce the same patch to 5.5

http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=a0e3cb08e616a67d3eaddef665e27566a774ef78

This patch is only required for a build on Windows; where it requires exports because of the build system.

The phpdbg codebase is compatible with 5.4+
