====== PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 7.4 ======
  * Date: 26th June, 2018
  * Author: Kalle Sommer Nielsen <kalle@php.net>, Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>
  * Status: In Draft

===== Introduction =====

This is a draft RFC for multiple deprecations targeting PHP 7.4. The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 7.4 and remove it in PHP 8.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * ''enable_dl'' php.ini directive
  * The 'real' type
  * The ''hebrev()'' & ''hebrevc()'' functions
  * Magic quotes legacy
  * ''%%__CLASS__%%'' constant
  * ''get_called_class()'' function
  * ''array_key_exists()'' with ''objects''
  * ''FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES'' filter
  * ''INPUT_SESSION'' & ''INPUT_REQUEST'' input types for the filter extension

The following are still Work-In-Progress and ideas:

  * Second parameter of spl_autoload() and its associated function spl_autoload_extensions()
  * convert_cyr_string()
  * allow_url_include ini directive
  * Unify parameter order for implode() to match explode()
  * Function variants that already exists as constants (e.g. php_sapi_name(), phpversion(), pi())
  * money_format()

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately. Each vote requires a 2/3 majority, independently of whether it is a language or standard library change. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 7.4 and removal in the next major version (presumably PHP 8.0).

==== enable_dl php.ini directive ====

The ''enable_dl'' php.ini directive controls whether or not the ''dl()'' function is available. However as of PHP 5.3, the ''dl()'' function was limited to the CLI and Embed SAPIs and between PHP 5.3.9 and 7.0.0, it was also available in the FPM SAPI.

This means that the ''enable_dl'' effectively has no greater meaning as it will never be available in a shared environment anyway, as any CLI user could easily bypass it anyway.

Proposal: Add a deprecation warning if ''enable_dl'' is non zero at start-up and when using CLI or Embed.

==== The 'real' type ====

Currently PHP has a float data type, with 2 additional aliases: double & real. The latter is very very rarely used and should be deprecated. This includes both the ''(real)'' type-cast and the ''is_real()'' function. Currently the ''settype()'' function does not support the 'real' string, so it is not affected.

Upgrading is relatively easy and can be done by replacing all ''(real)'' type-casts with ''(float)'' and all ''is_real()'' calls with ''is_float()''.

Proposal: Add a deprecation warning for each time the ''(real)'' type-cast is used and each time the ''is_real()'' function is called.

==== The hebrev() and hebrevc() functions ====

The ''hebrev()'' and ''hebrevc()'' functions are functions that helped make websites hebrew before browsers properly supported RTL, by simply converting the nature of RTL to LTR writing for easier display on websites. All modern browsers nowadays properly support unicode and RTL text direction and therefore it seems reasonable to deprecate these functions.

The ''hebrevc()'' function is essentially the same as calling ''nl2br()'' on the result of a ''hebrev()'' call.

Proposal: Add a deprecation warning if either ''hebrev()'' or ''hebrevc()'' is called.


==== Magic quotes legacy ====

PHP's infamous magic_quotes configuration was removed in PHP 5.4 and the function implementations of checking whether or not these settings have been enabled has returned false since then. With PHP 7.0 not having magic_quotes at all, it is time to deprecate these functions and remove them entirely.

This should effectively only hit legacy code bases prior to PHP 5.4, which is running non supported versions of PHP.

Proposal: Add a deprecation warning if either ''get_magic_quotes_gpc()'' or ''get_magic_quotes_runtime()'' is called.

==== __CLASS__ constant ====

This constant is the //old way// of detecting current class name.

Since PHP 5.5, ''%%__CLASS__%%'' is equivalent to ''self::class''.

Proposal: Deprecate ''%%__CLASS__%%'' constant in favor of ''self::class''.

==== get_called_class() function ====

This function is the //old way// of detecting current class name during LSB.

Since PHP 5.5, using ''get_called_class()'' is equivalent to ''static::class''.

Proposal: Deprecate ''get_called_class()'' in favor of ''static::class''.

==== array_key_exists() with objects ====

For backward compatibility reasons, ''array_key_exists()'' also works with objects and in such case behaves as ''property_exists()''.

Documented as a behavior that //should not be relied upon//, any usages of ''array_key_exists()'' on objects should be migrated to ''property_exists()''.

Proposal: Deprecate behavior where ''array_key_exists()'' accepts objects.

==== FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES ====

Magic quotes were deprecated all the way back in PHP 5.3 and later removed in PHP 5.4. The filter extension implements a sanitization filter that mimics this behavior of ''magic_quotes'' by calling ''addslashes()'' on the input in question.

As of PHP 7.3, a new alias of this filter was added ''add_slashes'' (''FILTER_SANITIZE_ADD_SLASHES'') to help ease the migration and allow us to move away from the ''magic_quotes'' name as calling ''addslashes()'' can still potentially be useful.

Proposed action: Emit a deprecation notice each time the ''FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES'' filter is used and advice users to use the ''add_slashes'' (''FILTER_SANITIZE_ADD_SLASHES'') filter.


==== INPUT_SESSION & INPUT_REQUEST input types for the filter extension ====

The filter extension implements a set of ''INPUT_XXX'' constants for telling the source of where the input is coming from. However the ''INPUT_SESSION'' and ''INPUT_REQUEST'' inputs were never implemented but their constants is and simply just emits an ''E_WARNING'' when used.

Impact: Minimal as they do not serve any function.

Proposed action: Keep the ''E_WARNING'' and mention that these will be removed in a future version of PHP.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 7.4 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 8.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.

===== Vote =====

Each of the bullet points above will get a separate vote. All votes will require a 2/3 supermajority, independently of whether they are language changes or not.

===== Changelog =====

  - 2018-07-05: Added ''%%__CLASS__%%'', ''get_called_class()'' and ''array_key_exists()'' with object arg (majkl)
