===== Introduction =====

Identifying trusted strings (defined by the programmer), with the function //is_literal(string $string)//.

Keep in mind "Taint Checking" is flawed - it supports escaping (hard and error prone), and gives a false sense of security.

But the basic idea can give us a lightweight, simple, and effective way to identify a common issue: Injection Vulnerabilities.

Used with a well tested library (SQL/HTML/CLI), which knows how to handle user data (parameterised queries and/or escaping), we have "Part 1" of a solution.

===== Background =====

==== The Problem ====

Injection and XSS vulnerabilities are **easy to make**, **hard to identify**, and **very common**.

We like to think all developers read the documentation, and never directly include (inject) user values into their SQL/HTML/CLI - but that's clearly not the case.

It's why these two issues have **always** been on the [[https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/|OWASP Top 10]]; a list designed to raise awareness of common issues, ranked on their prevalence, exploitability, detectability, and impact:

^  Year           ^  Injection Position  ^  XSS Position  ^
|  2017 - Latest  |  **1**               |  7             |
|  2013           |  **1**               |  3             |
|  2010           |  **1**               |  2             |
|  2007           |  2                   |  **1**         |
|  2004           |  6                   |  4             |
|  2003           |  6                   |  4             |

==== Examples ====

Libraries cannot protect themselves against the thousands of developers who use them incorrectly.

These developer mistakes are the main source of Injection Vulnerabilities:

<code php>
$qb->select('u')
   ->from('User', 'u')
   ->where('u.id = ' . $_GET['id']); // INSECURE
</code>

Here are a few [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-is-literal-rfc/blob/main/justification/mistakes.php?ts=4|example mistakes]].

Notice how the insecure examples are quick edits from the official documentation, they still "work", and are shorter/easier than doing it correctly. And I've found variations of all of these on production websites (after a while you get numb to it).

==== Trusted vs Safe ====

We cannot we say a string is "safe".

Take these examples:

<code php>
$cli = 'rm -rf ?';
$sql = 'DELETE FROM my_table WHERE my_date >= ?';
</code>

They are not "safe" as the parameters could be set to "/" or "0000-00-00" (a nice vanishing magic trick).

But they are "trusted", as they were written by the programmer (literals).

And yes, the programmer could do something stupid like this, but they will have much bigger issues to worry about:

<code php>
eval('$name = "' . $_GET['name'] . '";'); // INSECURE
</code>

==== Usage ====

Christoph Kern did a talk in 2016 about [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccfEu-Jj0as|Preventing Security Bugs through Software Design]] (also at [[https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/symposium-program/presentation/kern|USENIX Security 2015]]).

Summarised as "Don't Blame the Developer, Blame the API", we should put the burden on libraries (written once, well tested, and used by many) to ensure developers cannot make these common Injection Vulnerabilities.

This concept has been used in Go and Java projects at Google by using "Compile Time Constants", allowing them to create an "inherently safe API".

By providing a quick/simple way for libraries to check if the strings they receive came from the developer (from trusted PHP source code), it allows the library to check they are being //used// in a safe way (no user data can be //injected//).

===== Alternatives =====

These have been around for years, and have not worked.

==== Education ====

Developer training simply does not scale (people start programming every day) - learning about every single issue is difficult, and it's impossible to expect them to never make a mistake.

Programmers will frequently do just enough to complete their task (busy), often downloading a library or copy/paste something (risky), don't really understand it (risky), modify it for their needs (risky), then move on.

==== Escaping ====

Escaping is **hard**, and **error prone**.

There is a long list of common [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-is-literal-rfc/blob/main/justification/escaping.php?ts=4|escaping mistakes]].

Developers should use parameterised queries (e.g. SQL), or a well tested library that knows how to escape values based on their context (e.g. HTML). The //is_literal()// function works with this approach, allowing libraries to warn (or ensure) developers do it correctly.

==== Taint Checking ====

Some languages implement a "taint flag" which tracks whether values are considered "safe".

There is a [[https://github.com/laruence/taint|Taint extension for PHP]] by Xinchen Hui, and [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/taint|a previous RFC proposing it be added to the language]] by Wietse Venema.

This approach assumes the output of an escaping function is "safe" for a particular context. This sounds reasonable in theory, but the operation of escaping functions, and the context for which their output is safe, are very hard to define. This leads to a feature that is both complex and unreliable.

<code php>
$sql = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' . $db->real_escape_string($id); // INSECURE
$html = "<img src=" . htmlentities($url) . " alt='' />"; // INSECURE
$html = "<a href='" . htmlentities($url) . "'>..."; // INSECURE
</code>

The first two need the values to be quoted, but would be considered "untained" (wrong). The third example, htmlentities before PHP 8.1 ([[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/50eca61f68815005f3b0f808578cc1ce3b4297f0|fixed]]) does not escape single quotes by default, and it does not consider what happens with 'javascript:' URLs.

==== Static Analysis ====

I agree with [[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/109192|Tyson Andre]], please use Static Analysis.

But Static Analysis is simply not used by most developers (and never will be).

It's an extra step that most programmers cannot be bothered to do, especially those who are new to programming (usage tends to be higher by those writing well tested libraries).

Also, these tools currently focus on other issues (type checking, basic logic flaws, code formatting, etc), rarely attempting to address injection vulnerabilities. Those that do are [[https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/commit/2122e4a1756dac68a83ec3f5abfbc60331630781|often incomplete]], need sinks specified on all library methods (unlikely to happen), and are not enabled by default.

Take this example, using Psalm, even in its strictest errorLevel (1), and running //--taint-analysis// (I bet you don't use this), it will not notice the missing quote marks in this SQL, and incorrectly assume this is safe:

<code php>
$db = new mysqli('...');

$id = (string) ($_GET['id'] ?? 'id'); // Keep the type checker happy.

$db->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' . $db->real_escape_string($id)); // INSECURE
</code>

==== Reflection API ====

The Reflection API currently allows you to "introspect classes, interfaces, functions, methods and extensions"; it's not currently setup for object methods to inspect the code calling it. Even if that was to be added (unlikely), it could only check if the literal was defined there, it couldn't handle variables (tracking back to their source), nor could it provide any future scope for these checks happening in native functions (see "Phase 2").

==== Previous Work ====

Google uses "compile time constants" in **Go**, which isn't as good as a run time solution (e.g. the //WHERE IN// issue), but it works, and is used by [[https://blogtitle.github.io/go-safe-html/|go-safe-html]] and [[https://github.com/google/go-safeweb/tree/master/safesql|go-safesql]].

Google also uses [[https://errorprone.info/|Error Prone]] in **Java** to augment the compiler's type analysis, where [[https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/CompileTimeConstant|@CompileTimeConstant]] ensures method parameters can only use "compile-time constant expressions" (this isn't a complete solution either).

**Perl** has a [[https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsec#Taint-mode|Taint Mode]], via the -T flag, where all input is marked as "tainted", and cannot be used by some methods (like commands that modify files), unless you use a regular expression to match and return known-good values (where regular expressions are easy to get wrong).

**JavaScript** is looking to implement [[https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-is-template-object|isTemplateObject]] for "Distinguishing strings from a trusted developer from strings that may be attacker controlled" (intended to be [[https://github.com/mikewest/tc39-proposal-literals|used with Trusted Types]]).

As noted above, there is the [[https://github.com/laruence/taint|Taint extension for PHP]] by Xinchen Hui.

And there is the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/sql_injection_protection|Automatic SQL Injection Protection]] RFC by Matt Tait, where this RFC uses a similar concept of the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/sql_injection_protection#safeconst|SafeConst]]. When Matt's RFC was being discussed, it was noted:

  * "unfiltered input can affect way more than only SQL" ([[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/87355|Pierre Joye]]);
  * this amount of work isn't ideal for "just for one use case" ([[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/87647|Julien Pauli]]);
  * It would have effected every SQL function, such as //mysqli_query()//, //$pdo->query()//, //odbc_exec()//, etc (concerns raised by [[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/87436|Lester Caine]] and [[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/87650|Anthony Ferrara]]);
  * Each of those functions would need a bypass for cases where unsafe SQL was intentionally being used (e.g. phpMyAdmin taking SQL from POST data) because some applications intentionally "pass raw, user submitted, SQL" (Ronald Chmara [[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/87406|1]]/[[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/87446|2]]).

I also agree that "SQL injection is almost a solved problem [by using] prepared statements" ([[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/87400|Scott Arciszewski]]), and this is the point of //is_literal()// - so we can check that no mistakes have been made.

===== Proposal =====

Add //is_literal(string $string): bool// to check if a variable contains a string defined in the PHP script.

A literal is defined as a value (string) which has been written by the programmer.

<code php>
is_literal('Example'); // true

$a = 'Hello';
$b = 'World';

is_literal($a); // true

is_literal($_GET['id']); // false
is_literal('WHERE id = ' . intval($_GET['id'])); // false
is_literal(rand(1, 10)); // false
is_literal(sprintf('LIMIT %d', 3)); // false

function example($input) {
  if (!is_literal($input)) {
    throw new Exception('Non-literal detected!');
  }
  return $input;
}

example($a); // OK
example(example($a)); // OK, still the same literal.
example(strtoupper($a)); // Exception thrown.
</code>

Because so much existing code uses string concatenation, and because it does not modify what the programmer has written, concatenated literals will keep their flag, which includes the use of //str_repeat()//, //str_pad()//, //implode()//, //join()//, //array_pad()//, and //array_fill()//.

<code php>
is_literal($a . $b); // true

is_literal(str_repeat($a, 10)); // true
is_literal(str_repeat($a, rand(1, 10))); // true
is_literal(str_repeat(rand(1, 10), 10)); // false, non-literal input

is_literal(str_pad($a, 10, '-')); // true
is_literal(str_pad($a, 10, rand(1, 10))); // false

is_literal(implode(' AND ', [$a, $b])); // true
is_literal(implode(' AND ', [$a, rand(1, 10)])); // false

is_literal(array_pad([$a], 10, $b)); // true
is_literal(array_pad([$a], rand(1, 10), $b)); // true
is_literal(array_pad([$a], 10, rand(1, 10))); // false
is_literal(array_pad([$a, rand(1, 10)], 10, $b)); // false

is_literal(array_fill(0, 10, $a)); // true
is_literal(array_fill(0, 10, rand(1, 10))); // false
</code>

There is no method to mark a string as a literal (i.e. no equivalent to //untaint()//); as soon as the value has been manipulated or includes anything that is not from a literal (e.g. user data), it is no longer marked as a literal (important).

===== Usage =====

==== Basic ====

How a library could use //is_literal()//:

<code php>
class db {

  protected $protection_level = 1;
    // 1 = Just warnings
    // 2 = Exceptions, maybe the default in a few years.

  function literal_check($var) {
    if (!function_exists('is_literal') || is_literal($var)) {
      // Fine - This is a programmer defined string (bingo), or not using PHP 8.1
    } else if ($var instanceof unsafe_sql) {
      // Fine - Not ideal, but at least they know this one is unsafe.
    } else if ($this->protection_level === 0) {
      // Fine - Programmer aware, and is choosing to disable this check everywhere.
    } else if ($this->protection_level === 1) {
      trigger_error('Non-literal detected!', E_USER_WARNING);
    } else {
      throw new Exception('Non-literal detected!');
    }
  }
  function enforce_injection_protection() {
    $this->protection_level = 2;
  }
  function unsafe_disable_injection_protection() {
    $this->protection_level = 0; // Use unsafe_sql for special cases.
  }

  function where($sql, $parameters = [], $aliases = []) {
    $this->literal_check($sql); // Used any time an argument should be checked.
    // ...
  }

}
</code>

You will notice this library supports an //unsafe_sql// value-object which bypasses this check. This should only be a temporary thing, as there are much safer ways of handling exceptions.

<code php>
class unsafe_sql {
  private $value = '';
  function __construct($unsafe_sql) {
    $this->value = $unsafe_sql;
  }
  function __toString() {
    return $this->value;
  }
}
</code>

How this library would be used:

<code php>
$db = new db();
$db->where('id = ?'); // OK
$db->where('id = ' . $_GET['id']); // Mistake detected (warning given)
</code>

==== WHERE IN ====

When you have an undefined number of parameters; for example //WHERE IN//.

You should already be following the advice from [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/23641033/538216|Levi Morrison]], [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.execute.php#example-1012|PDO Execute]], and [[https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/security/writing-secure-code/database-access#s-multiple-arguments|Drupal Multiple Arguments]]:

<code php>
$sql = 'WHERE id IN (' . join(',', array_fill(0, count($ids), '?')) . ')';
</code>

Or, if you prefer to use concatenation:

<code php>
$sql = '?';
for ($k = 1; $k < $count; $k++) {
  $sql .= ',?';
}
</code>

This will push everyone to use parameters properly, rather than using implode() on user values, and including them directly in the SQL (which is easy to get wrong).

==== Non Parameterised Values ====

Table and Fields in SQL cannot use parameters, but are often written as literals anyway.

And you can //still// use literals when it's dependent on user input:

<code php>
$order_fields = [
    'name',
    'created',
    'admin',
  ];

$order_id = array_search(($_GET['sort'] ?? NULL), $order_fields);

$sql .= ' ORDER BY ' . $order_fields[$order_id];
</code>

By using an allow-list, we ensure the user (attacker) cannot use anything unexpected.

==== Special Cases ====

And for a real edge case, where the end user must provide the table/field names (maybe a weird CMS that changes the table structure).

The database abstraction should still accept those values separately (like how parameters are accepted separately). This ensures the majority of the SQL is a literal (good), then it can consistently check/escape those table/field names when applying them to the SQL (also good).

[[https://gist.github.com/craigfrancis/5b057414de4119bcc80163ac669a7360#file-is_literal-php-L235|How it can be done]].

===== Considerations =====

==== Naming ====

A "Literal String" is the standard name for strings in source code. See [[https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+literal+string+in+php|Google]].

> A string literal is the notation for representing a string value within the text of a computer program. In PHP, strings can be created with single quotes, double quotes or using the heredoc or the nowdoc syntax...

Alternative suggestions have included //is_from_literal()// from [[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/109197|Jakob Givoni]], and references to alternative implementations like "compile time constants" and "code string". We cannot call it //is_safe_string()// (see above).

==== Int/Float/Boolean Values. ====

When converting to string, they aren't guaranteed (and often don't) have the exact same value they have in source code.

For example, //TRUE// and //true// when cast to string give "1".

It's also a very low value feature, and there might not be space for a flag to be added.

==== Performance ====

To do this testing, Máté Kocsis has created a [[https://github.com/kocsismate/php-version-benchmarks/|php benchmark]] to replicate the old [[https://01.org/node/3774|Intel Tests]].

The [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-is-literal-rfc/blob/main/tests/results/with-concat/kocsismate.pdf|preliminary testing on this implementation]] has found a 0.124% performance hit for the Laravel Demo app, 0.161% for Symfony (rounds 4-6, which involved 5000 requests). These tests do not connect to a database, as the variability introduced makes it impossible to measure the difference.

There is a more severe 3.719% when running this [[https://github.com/kocsismate/php-version-benchmarks/blob/main/app/zend/concat.php#L25|concat test]], which is not representative of a typical PHP script (it's not normal to concatenate 4 strings, 5 million times, with no other actions).

==== String Concatenation ====

Technically concat support isn't needed for most libraries, like an ORM or Query Builder, where their methods nearly always take small literal strings. But it does make the adoption of //is_literal()// easier for existing projects that are currently using string concat for their SQL/HTML/CLI/etc.

Dan Ackroyd has considered an approach that does not use string concatenation at run time. The intention was to reduce the performance impact even further; and by introducing //literal_concat()// or //literal_implode()// support functions, it would make it easier for developers identify their mistakes.

Performance wise, I made up a test patch (not properly checked), to skip string concat at runtime, and with my own [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-is-literal-rfc/tree/main/tests|simplistic testing]] the [[https://github.com/craigfrancis/php-is-literal-rfc/blob/main/tests/results/with-concat/local.pdf|results]] found:

    Laravel Demo App: +0.30% with, vs +0.18% without concat.
    Symfony Demo App: +0.06% with, vs +0.06% without concat.
    My Concat Test:   +4.36% with, vs +2.23% without concat.
    -
    Website with 22 SQL queries: Inconclusive, too variable.

There is still a small impact without concat support as the //concat_function()// in "zend_operators.c" uses //zend_string_extend()// needs to remove the literal flag. And in "zend_vm_def.h", it has a similar version; and supports a quick concat with an empty string, which doesn't create a new variable (x2) and would need its flag removed as well.

Also, supporting runtime concat would make //is_literal()// easier to understand, as the compiler can sometimes concat strings (making a single literal), making it appear that concat works in some cases but not others.

==== String Splitting ====

This behaviour is very different to String Concatenation.

Taking "trusted" to mean that it came from the developer - Splitting a trusted string with something that is not trusted (e.g. length), creates an untrusted modification.

Or in other words; trying to determine if the //is_literal// flag should be passed through functions like //substr()// is difficult. Having a security feature be difficult to reason about, gives a much higher chance of mistakes.

Also, we cannot find any use-cases.

==== Support Functions ====

Dan Ackroyd has proposed the //literal_concat()// and //literal_implode()// functions, which can be created as userland functions.

Developers may want to use these to help identify exactly where mistakes are made, for example:

<code php>
$sortOrder = 'ASC';

// 300 lines of code, or multiple function calls

$sql .= ' ORDER BY name ' . $sortOrder;

// 300 lines of code, or multiple function calls

$db->query($sql);
</code>

If a developer changed the literal //'ASC'// to //$_GET['order']//, the error would be noticed by //$db->query()//, but it's not clear where the mistake was made. Whereas, if they were using //literal_concat()//, it could raise an exception much earlier, and highlight exactly where the mistake happened:

<code php>
$sql = literal_concat($sql, ' ORDER BY name ', $sortOrder);
</code>

==== Non Literal Values ====

As noted by [[https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/87667|Dennis Birkholz]], some Systems/Frameworks currently define certain variables (e.g. table name prefixes) without the use of a literal (e.g. ini/json/yaml).

And Larry Garfield notes that in Drupal's ORM "the table name itself is user-defined" (not in the PHP script).

While most systems will be able to use literals entirely, those that cannot will be able to use a Query Builder - one that validates the majority of its inputs are literals, and the exceptions can be accepted via appropriate validation and escaping (i.e. does this string match a known table name, or a valid format).

Have a look at [[https://gist.github.com/craigfrancis/5b057414de4119bcc80163ac669a7360|this example gist]] to see all the different ways this can be done.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

No known BC breaks, except for code-bases that already contain the userland function //is_literal()//.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

None known

==== To Existing Extensions ====

Not sure

==== To Opcache ====

Not sure

===== Open Issues =====

None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

None known

===== Future Scope =====

As noted by MarkR, the biggest benefit will come when it can be used by PDO and similar functions (//mysqli_query//, //preg_match//, //exec//, etc). But the basic idea can be used immediately by frameworks and general abstraction libraries, and they can give feedback for future work.

**Phase 2** could introduce a way for programmers to specify certain PHP function/method arguments can only accept literals, and/or specific value-objects their project trusts (this idea comes from [[https://web.dev/trusted-types/|Trusted Types]] in JavaScript, and their [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po6GumtHRmU&t=92s|60+ Injection Sinks]] - like innerHTML).

For example, a project could require the second argument for //pg_query()// only accept literals or their //query_builder_sql// object (which provides a //__toString// method); and that any output (print, echo, readfile, etc) must use the //html_output// object that's returned by their trusted HTML Templating system (using //ob_start()// might be useful here).

**Phase 3** could set a default of 'only literals' for all of the relevant PHP function arguments, so developers are given a warning when they provide an unsafe value to those functions (they could still specify that unsafe values are allowed, e.g. phpMyAdmin). And in ~10 years, the warning could change to an exception.

And, for a bit of silliness (Spaß ist verboten), MarkR would like a //is_figurative()// function (functionality to be confirmed).
