====== PHP RFC: Generic arrays ======

===== Introduction =====

This RFC is supplemental to the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generics|generics RFC]].

This RCF proposes the addition of generic arrays and enhancements to array-related functions.

TBD: should generic versions of the standard (SPL) collection types in PHP be part of this RFC?

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes the addition of two generic, type-checked countersparts to the built-in ''array'' type: one with a value type, and one with key and value types.

The ''array'' keyword is overloaded, such that the following will work as expected:

<code>
$counts = array<string, int>(); // array<TKey,TValue>
$counts["kittens"] = 12;

$versions = array<float>(); // array<TValue>
$versions["php"] = 7.1;
</code>

Violating the key or value type of a type-checked array will trigger a ''TypeError''.

The actual type-checks or type-conversions performed will depend on the ''strict_mode'' flag and normal type conversion rules.

Note that there is no generic form of the short array syntax - generic arrays can only be created explicitly by using the ''array'' keyword.

=== Array Type-casting ===

Generic arrays can be explicitly [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php#language.types.array.casting|type-cast]] using the following syntax:

<code php>
$array = [1,2,3];

$numbers = (array<int>) $array;
</code>

In this example, the array is fully copied, and every element is type-checked, because ''int'' is a less general element type than ''mixed''.

Casting to a less general index or element type than that of the source array, results in creation of a new array, and keys/elements being copied. If an index or element in the source array is incompatible with the index or element types of the created generic array, a ''TypeError'' is triggered.

If an array is cast to a more general (or identical) index and element type, a lazy reference to the source array is made, identical to how PHP arrays normally work internally.

The following results in an implicit type-cast:

<code php>
function tally(array<int> $numbers) {
    // ...
}

tally([7,8,9]);
</code>

In this case, the implicit type-cast is successful. In a case where the conversion fails, a ''TypeError'' is thrown.

=== Reification ===

TODO describe reification of generic type arguments, describe ''array_type()'' and ''array_key_type()'' functions.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

No BC breaks are expected from this proposal.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

TBD

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

For this proposal to be accepted, a 2/3 majority is required.
