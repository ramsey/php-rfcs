===== Proposal =====

==== Introduction ====

Currently variadic functions are implemented by fetching the function arguments using ''func_get_args()''. The following code sample shows an implementation of a variadic function used to prepare and execute a MySQL query (I'll be making use of this example throughout the RFC):

<code php>
class MySQL implements DB {
    protected $pdo;
    public function query($query) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
        $stmt->execute(array_slice(func_get_args(), 1));
        return $stmt;
    }
    // ...
}

$userData = $db->query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', $userID)->fetch();
</code>

There are two issues with the above approach:

Firstly, by just looking at the function signature ''public function query($query)'' you cannot know that this is actually a variadic function. You'd think that the function can only run a normal query and doesn't support bound parameters.

Secondly, because ''func_get_args()'' returns *all* arguments passed to the function you first need to remove the ''$query''
parameter using ''array_slice(func_get_args(), 1)''.

This RFC proposed to solve these issues by adding a special syntax for variadic functions:

<code php>
class MySQL implements DB {
    public function query($query, ...$params) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
        $stmt->execute($params);
        return $stmt;
    }
    // ...
}

$userData = $db->query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', $userID)->fetch();
</code>

The ''%%...$params%%'' syntax indicates that this is a variadic function and that all arguments after ''$query'' should be put into the ''$params'' array. Using the new syntax both of the issues mentioned above are solved.

==== Population of variadic parameter ====

The following example shows how the variadic parameter ''%%...$params%%'' is populated depending on the number of passed arguments:

<code php>
function fn($reqParam, $optParam = null, ...$params) {
    var_dump($reqParam, $optParam, $params);
}

fn(1);             // 1, null, []
fn(1, 2);          // 1, 2, []
fn(1, 2, 3);       // 1, 2, [3]
fn(1, 2, 3, 4);    // 1, 2, [3, 4]
fn(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // 1, 2, [3, 4, 5]
</code>

''$params'' will be an empty array if the number of passed arguments is smaller than the number of declared parameters. Any further arguments will be added to the ''$params'' array (in the order in which they were passed). The ''$params'' array is using continuous zero-based indices.

==== By-reference capture ====

The new syntax additionally adds support for capturing variadic arguments by-reference, something that was previously not possible in userland code. Only internal functions could make use of this via ''ZEND_ACC_PASS_REST_BY_REF''.

This would allow implementing functions like ''sscanf()'' or ''mysqli_stmt::bind_param()'' in userland. The following method uses the new syntax to prepare a query and bind parameters by-reference to it:

<code php>
class MySQL implements DB {
    public function prepare($query, &...$params) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
        foreach ($params as $i => &$param) {
            $stmt->bindParam($i + 1, $param);
        }
        return $stmt;
    }
    // ...
}

$stmt = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', $name, $email, $age);
foreach ($usersToInsert as list($name, $email, $age)) {
    $stmt->execute();
}
</code>

A by-reference capture of variadic arguments is indicated by a ''&'' before the ellipsis ''%%...%%''.

==== Type hints ====

Furthermore it's possible to provide a typehint that all variadic arguments are checked against. E.g. this is how the signature of ''array_merge'' implemented in userland would look like:

<code php>
function array_merge(array ...$arrays) { /* ... */ }
</code>

PHP would make sure that all arguments are actually arrays. This also works for all other typehints like ''%%callable ...$callbacks%%'' or ''%%Route ...$routes%%''.

==== Prototype checks ====

An advantage of declaring variadics in the parameter list is that the signature can be enforced by intefaces and during inheritance. The ''MySQL::query()'' and ''MySQL::prepare()'' examples above already referenced an interface ''DB''. This is how the interface could look like:

<code php>
interface DB {
    public function query($query, ...$params);
    public function prepare($query, &...$params);
    // ...
}
</code>

This interface will force any implementation to make both these functions variadic and will also enforce the by-ref capture for ''prepare()''.

The exact protoype checks (what is valid and what is not) are outlined below:

<code php>
// INVALID: Turning a variadic function into a non-variadic one
public function query($query, ...$params)
public function query($query)

// VALID: Turning a non-variadic function into a variadic one
public function query($query)
public function query($query, ...$params)
// Note: This is allowed as ...$params is optional and PHP allows additional optional arguments

// INVALID: Changing the passing mode for variadic parameters
public function query($query, &...$params)
public function query($query, ...$params)

// INVALID: Changing the typehint of a variadic parameter to an incompatible typehint
public function query($query, array ...$params)
public function query($query, callable ...$params)

// INVALID: Removing parameter before the variadic parameter
public function query($query, ...$params)
public function query(...$params)
// Note: Personally I don't think this makes sense, but this is how
//       PHP behaves in general, so I'm staying consistent with it

// VALID: Adding additional optional parameter before the variadic parameter (with compatible typehint)
public function query($query, array ...$params)
public function query($query, array $extraParam = null, array ...$params)

// INVALID: Adding additional optional parameter with incompatible typehint
public function query($query, array ...$params)
public function query($query, callable $extraParam = null, array ...$params)
</code>

==== Syntactic restrictions ====

There may be only one variadic parameter and it needs to be the last parameter of the function. A variadic parameter may not have a default value.

As such all of the following are invalid:

<code php>
function fn(...$args, $arg)
function fn(...$args1, ...$args2)
function fn($arg, ...$args = [])
</code>

==== Reflection ====

Two new methods are added to Reflection:

<code php>
bool ReflectionFunction::isVariadic()
bool ReflectionParameter::isVariadic()
</code>

The functions will return ''true'' if the function/parameter is variadic, ''false'' otherwise.

==== Summary ====

To sum up, the feature adds the following new syntax:

  * ''%%function fn($arg, ...$args)%%'': Capture all variadic arguments into the ''$args'' array
  * ''%%function fn($arg, &...$args)%%'': Do the capture by reference
  * ''%%function fn($arg, array ...$args)%%'': Enforce that all variadic arguments are arrays (or some other typehint)
  * ''%%function fn($arg, array &...$args)%%'': Combine both - variadic arguments are arrays that are captured by-reference

The advantages of the syntax are:

  * It's immidiately clear that a function is variadic, without having to read documentation.
  * It is no longer necessary to ''array_slice()'' the variadic arguments from ''func_get_args()''
  * It is now possible to do variadic by-reference captures
  * Types can be checked with a typehint (rather than a manual loop)
  * Variadic prototypes can be enforce in interfaces / by inheritance

===== Backwards compatibility =====

==== Userland ====

This change does not break backwards comparability for userland code.

In particular, this RFC does not propose to deprecate or remove the ''func_get_args()'' family of functions, at least not any time soon.
  
==== Internal ====

The ''pass_rest_by_ref'' argument of ''ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_INFO'' and ''ZEND_BEING_ARG_INFO_EX'' is no longer used. Instead functions can declare a variadic argument in the arginfo using ''ZEND_ARG_VARIADIC_INFO''.

For example, this is how the arginfo for ''sscanf()'' changed:

<code c>
// OLD:
ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_INFO_EX(arginfo_sscanf, 1, 0, 2)
    ZEND_ARG_INFO(0, str)
    ZEND_ARG_INFO(0, format)
    ZEND_ARG_INFO(1, ...)
ZEND_END_ARG_INFO()
 
// NEW:
ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_INFO_EX(arginfo_sscanf, 0, 0, 2)
    ZEND_ARG_INFO(0, str)
    ZEND_ARG_INFO(0, format)
    ZEND_ARG_VARIADIC_INFO(1, vars)
ZEND_END_ARG_INFO()
</code>

It would theoretically be possible to retain support for ''pass_rest_by_ref'' (by automatically generating a variadic arg), but as this is an exceedingly rarely used feature I don't think this is necessary. All usages of it in php-src have been replaced.

Apart from this the change should be transparent from an internals point of view. Macros like ''ARG_MUST_BE_SENT_BY_REF'' continue to work.

===== Discussion =====

==== Choice of syntax ====

Presumably this RFC will quickly deteriorate towards a bike-shedding of the best syntax for variadic parameters, so I'll try to explain my choice for the proposed syntax right away:

The use of ''%%...%%'' is already familiar from the PHP documentation, where variadics are denoted using a trailing ''%%$...%%'' parameter. The reason ''%%...%%'' follows *before* the parameter in the proposed syntax is to clearly show that the typehint/ref-modifier before it applies to all arguments.

Some possible alternative syntax and why I don't like it:

  * ''%%$args...%%''. With ref-modifier (''%%&$args...%%'') this does not show well that the individual arguments are references, rather than ''$args'' itself. With typehint (''%%array $args...%%'') it also looks like the typehint applies to ''$args'' itself rather than all variadic arguments.
  * ''*$args''. This is the syntax that both Ruby and Python use. For PHP this does not work well because ''*$'' is a weird combination. It gets worse with a by-reference capture: ''&*$args''. This looks like a random sequences of special characters. Combined with a typehint the syntax looks a lot like a pointer: ''Foo *$args''.
  * ''params $args''. This is what C# does. This would require making ''params'' a keyword. Furthermore this doesn't have any nice way to declare typehints. In C# this is done using ''params type[] args'', but PHP doesn't have ''type[]'' hints and introducing them only here doesn't seem right.
 
The proposed syntax is also used by Java and will be used in [[http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:rest_parameters|Javascript (ECMAScript Harmony proposal)]].
