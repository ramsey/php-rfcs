===== Introduction =====

HTTP session management is core of Web security. Current default of session module is weaker and default would be better to choose secure values.

===== Proposal =====

Secure setting should be the default and user should selectively use weaker setting.

**use_strict_mode=on** disallow user supplied session ID and improve session ID security. Most applications work with this option. Change session_id() to allow any id regardless of this mode.

**cookie_httponly=on** disallow use of session ID cookie from JavaScript. It reduces risk of stolen session ID via JavaScript injections. Most applications work with this option.

**hash_function=1** SHA1 has larger bits than MD5. (192 bits vs 128 bits) More difficult to guess. Most application work with SHA1 also. php.ini-development/production hash_bits_per_character is 5 already. Make compiled default to 5 also.

**Add chars to allowed chars** When hash_bits_per_character=6, session module uses all of allowed chars for files save handler. Add '_' to allowed chars. It's useful for prefixing session ID by session_create_id().


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

use_script_mode=on: Do not accept user provide value (This is good for security)

cookie_httponly=on: JavaScript cannot access session cookie (This is good for security)

hash_function=1: Longer string. This would not be issue for almost all apps.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 5.6

**Add chars to allowed chars** is PHP-5.5 and up.


===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

Session module

===== php.ini Defaults =====

  * hardcoded default values
  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

use_script_mode=on, cookie_httponly=on, hash_function=1, hash_bits_per_character=5 for all
 

===== Open Issues =====
