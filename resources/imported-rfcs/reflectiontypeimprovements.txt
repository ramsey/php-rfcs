====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2016-06-10
  * Author: Levi Morrison <levim@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/ReflectionTypeImprovements

===== Introduction =====
For PHP 7.0 the ''ReflectionType'' API was introduced in conjunction with [[rfc::return_types] | return types]]. Its minimal API was intended to be the base for future improvements; this RFC are those improvements.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC adds several new subtypes for ''ReflectionType''; here is their hierarchy:

  * ReflectionType (already exists)
    * ReflectionSingularType
      * ReflectionIntType
      * ReflectionFloatType
      * ReflectionBoolType
      * ReflectionStringType
      * ReflectionArrayType
      * ReflectionCallableType
      * ReflectionVoidType
      * ReflectionClassType

''ReflectionSingularType'' has a new method named ''getName()'' which returns the string name of the type it represents. A call to the ''getName()'' method of a ''SingularType'' that represents any of ''int'',''?int'' or ''int $foo = null'' will return ''int'' in each case. Here is a stub the represents its API:

<PHP>
class ReflectionSingularType extends ReflectionType {
    public function getName(): string;
}
</PHP>

''ReflectionClassType'' has an additional method ''getClass()'' that obtains the ''ReflectionClass'' of the type it represents. Here is its stub:

<PHP>
class ReflectionClassType extends ReflectionSingularType {
    public function getClass(): ReflectionClass;
}
</PHP>

The engine will return a subtype of ''ReflectionSingularType'' if possible. For builtin types the engine will return ''ReflectionIntType'', ''ReflectionFloatType'', etc as appropriate. If the engine does not recognize a type it will call the autoloader; if the class is found then a ''ReflectionClassType'' will be returned and otherwise a plain ''ReflectionSingularType'' will be returned.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There is a change for ''<nowiki>ReflectionType::__toString()</nowiki>'' which will now include a ''?'' for nullable types. This change is justified for several reason:

  - ''ReflectionType'' was introduced in 7.0 and therefore adoption is low
  - The change reflects the intention of the meaning of ''<nowiki>__toString</nowiki>''. Unfortunately this intention wasn't formally documented, thus classifying this as a BC break.

===== PHP Version =====
This RFC targets PHP 7.Next which is currently version 7.1.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
`ReflectionClass` is unaffected; this only touches `ReflectionType`.

===== Voting =====
It is unclear if voting requires 50%+1 or 2/3. On one hand this is not a language change but on the other this does contain a BC break. Rather than debating it one way or the other I've chosen to require 2/3.

The vote will be a simple yes or no for these changes.

===== Patches and Tests =====
The patch for this is not difficult; it will be coming soon.
