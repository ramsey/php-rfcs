====== PHP RFC: Internal operator overloading and GMP improvements ======
  * Version: 0.1

  * Target version: PHP 5.6 (or whatever the next one is)

PHP offers facilities for large number and decimal arithmetic (GMP and BCMath), but currently using those is a PITA. This RFC proposes to improve the situation by adding support for *operator overloading in internal classes*. Furthermore this RFC exemplarily implements the new API for GMP (and improves the GMP in various ways along the way).
