===== Introduction =====

HKDF is informational internet standard defined by [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869|RFC 5869]]. HKDF is designed to generate secure key for encryption/validation/authentication/etc from other key information such as output from hash_password(), API KEY, etc. hash_hkdf() is added to master without RFC already. It has following signature currently.

<code>
  string hash_hkdf(string algo, string ikm [, int length = 0 [, string info = '' [, string salt = '']]])
</code>

Issue is parameter order and handling. 

RFC 5869 notes for HKDF users. It states,

<blockquote>3.1.  To Salt or not to Salt

HKDF is defined to operate with and without random salt.  This is
done to accommodate applications where a salt value is not available.
We stress, however, that the use of salt adds significantly to the
strength of HKDF, ensuring independence between different uses of the
hash function, supporting "source-independent" extraction, and
strengthening the analytical results that back the HKDF design.

Random salt differs fundamentally from the initial keying material in
two ways: it is non-secret and can be re-used.  As such, salt values
are available to many applications.  For example, a pseudorandom
number generator (PRNG) that continuously produces outputs by
applying HKDF to renewable pools of entropy (e.g., sampled system
events) can fix a salt value and use it for multiple applications of
HKDF without having to protect the secrecy of the salt.  In a
different application domain, a key agreement protocol deriving
cryptographic keys from a Diffie-Hellman exchange can derive a salt
value from public nonces exchanged and authenticated between
communicating parties as part of the key agreement (this is the
approach taken in [IKEv2]).

Ideally, the salt value is a random (or pseudorandom) string of the
length HashLen.  Yet, even a salt value of less quality (shorter in
size or with limited entropy) may still make a significant
contribution to the security of the output keying material; designers
of applications are therefore encouraged to provide salt values to
HKDF if such values can be obtained by the application.

It is worth noting that, while not the typical case, some
applications may even have a secret salt value available for use; in
such a case, HKDF provides an even stronger security guarantee.  An
example of such application is IKEv1 in its "public-key encryption
mode", where the "salt" to the extractor is computed from nonces that
are secret; similarly, the pre-shared mode of IKEv1 uses a secret
salt derived from the pre-shared key.
</blockquote>

As you can see from the RFC, it states even weak salt can make HKDF result much stronger than without salt. Thus users should supply salt whenever it is possible even if it can be omitted. HKDF is designed to be stronger with salt. 

==== hash_hkdf() applications =====

This RFC only describes 2 examples, but there are many HKDF application. e.g. Object Store, etc. Developers must consider salt use for better security rather than omitting salt without proper consideration.

=== Per user data encryption ===

  - Get the password hash generated by hash_password() for the user
  - Get application secret salt stored in secure place. i.g. $_ENV
  - Generate HKDF hash value with 1 and 2 by hash_hkdf()
  - Encrypt the user data with the key from 3

Although "salt" can be omitted, per user data encryption can be much stronger for attacks. 

Suppose your application had SQL injection vulnerability and your data is stolen including password hash and encrypted user data. Secret encrypted data can be decrypted by attackers if salt is NOT used. 

See also **Security Note** section blow. The same technique can be used for per user encryption key.

=== CSRF token ===

When session ID is used for CSRF token, there is risk that session ID can leak to others by saving & sending HTML page, by malware web browser plugins that read page content, etc. Therefore, session ID should not be used as CSRF token. HKDF can be used to generate CSRF token belong to specific session with salt.

Setting up CSRF token
  - Get expiration timestamp as salt
  - Generate HKDF value with 1 and session ID
  - Send key from 2 and timestamp from 1 to browser as CSRF token

Verifying CSRF token
  - Get HKDF key and timestamp(salt) value from request
  - Check if timestamp is not expired
  - Generate HKDF value session ID and timestamp(salt)
  - Compare HKDF value sent by browser and server generated HKDF value if it matches

Secure CSRF token expiration can be defined with this method regardless of session ID lifetime. i.e. You can set short CSRF token expiration securely.

==Security Note== 
Users must regenerate session ID periodically regardless of SSL usage for security reasons. Current OWASP recommends to regenerate rather short period. (Absolute timeout discussion is described in next section.)

<blockquote>Common idle timeouts ranges are 2-5 minutes for high-value applications and 15- 30 minutes for low risk applications.</blockquote>
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Session_Expiration

Therefore, use of session ID as CSRF token key source is not recommended. You are better to use separate key for CSRF token generation in $_SESSION. e.g. $_SESSION['CSRF_TOKEN_IKM'] = session_create_id(); Use secret $_SESSION['CSRF_TOKEN_IKM'] for HKDF key generation where above example use session ID. With this method, you can generate secure HKDF CSRF token even when session ID is regenerated with your defined token expiration time. 

==Use of info parameter==

"info" parameter may be used to specify domain for generated key. In CSRF context, domain could be "admin", "editor", "user", "visitor", etc. For example, if "admin" is required for all administrative features, even if administrator's CSRF token for other domains, e.g. "user", are stolen, administrative features are protected from CSRF attacks.

===== Proposal =====

Internet RFC clearly recommends "salt" value whenever it is possible

Change hash_hkdf() from

<code>
string hash_hkdf(string algo, string ikm [, int length = 0 [, string info = '' [, string salt = '']]])
</code>

to

<code>
string hash_hkdf(string algo, string ikm, string salt [, string info = ''])
 - Set empty string to use without salt.
 - Note: length is only used for internal execution optimization. It will set to proper value according to inputs.
</code>

From user perspective, "salt" and "info" parameters can be used interchangeably. However, it would be good idea to follow RFC 5869 semantics. 
Unlike "info" which could be an optional, "salt" cannot be an optional with expiration enabled keys. This kind of expiration is common. e.g. Amazon AWS S3 uses HKDF with expiration to allow access to objects. 

Typical PHP applications that need HKDF can use (or should use) salt for security reasons as examples above. Users should consider if salt can be used or not. If use of salt is impossible, then it should set to be empty. They shouldn't omit salt without consideration which could lead serious security issue. Therefore, salt is better to be required parameter.
