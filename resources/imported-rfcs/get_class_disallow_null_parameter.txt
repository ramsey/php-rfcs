====== PHP RFC: get_class() disallow null parameter ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2016-08-12
  * Author: Danack
  * Status: Draft 
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/get_class_disallow_null_parameter

===== Introduction =====

When null is passed as the parameter to get_class() inside a class context, the behaviour of the function can be highly surprising, 

<code php>
class Foo
{
    function bar($repository)
    {
        $result = $repository->find(100);

        echo get_class($result);
    }
}
</code>


If $result contains a valid object returned from the repository, the output will be of the class name of the type of $result.

If $result contains null, the output will be of the class context where get_class() was called from, in this case "Foo".

===== Proposal =====

Disallow null being passed to the function as a valid parameter.

I.e. the valid ways to call the function will be:

* called without any parameter.
* called with an object as the parameter.

Those two options will continue to have the same behaviour they currently have.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Most people won't see a BC break, as for the majority of people, passing null to this function is not a desired behaviour.

For people who do deliberately pass null to the function they will need to refactor their code from:

<code php>
$x = get_class($some_value_that_may_be_null);
</code>

to:

<code php>
if ($some_value_that_may_be_null === null) {
    $x = null;
}
else {
    $x = get_class($some_value_that_may_be_null);
}
</code>

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
7.2

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

The voting question will be "Should the function be changed to disallow null being passed as a parameter?" with yes/no being the options. As it is not a language or syntax change, the vote will pass if 50%+1 vote yes.
