===== Introduction =====

Generators provide an easy, boilerplate-free way of implementing iterators.

As an example, consider how you would implement the ''file()'' function in userland code:

<code php>
function getLinesFromFile($fileName) {
    if (!$fileHandle = fopen($fileName, 'r')) {
        return;
    }
    
    $lines = [];
    while (false !== $line = fgets($fileHandle)) {
        $lines[] = $line;
    }
    
    fclose($fileHandle);
    
    return $lines;
}

$lines = getLinesFromFile($fileName);
foreach ($lines as $line) {
    // do something with $line
}
</code>

The main disadvantage of this kind of code is evident: It will read the whole file into a large array. Depending
on how big the file is, this can easily hit the memory limit. This is not what you usually want. Instead you
want to get the lines one by one. This is what iterators are perfect for.

Sadly implementing iterators requires an insane amount of boilerplate code. E.g. consider this iterator variant
of the above function:

<code php>
class LineIterator implements Iterator {
    protected $fileHandle;
    
    protected $line;
    protected $i;
    
    public function __construct($fileName) {
        if (!$this->fileHandle = fopen($fileName, 'r')) {
            throw new RuntimeException('Couldn\'t open file "' . $fileName . '"');
        }
    }
    
    public function rewind() {
        fseek($this->fileHandle, 0);
        $this->line = fgets($this->fileHandle);
        $this->i = 0;
    }
    
    public function valid() {
        return false !== $this->line;
    }
    
    public function current() {
        return $this->line;
    }
    
    public function key() {
        return $this->i;
    }
    
    public function next() {
        if (false !== $this->line) {
            $this->line = fgets($this->fileHandle);
            $this->i++;
        }
    }
    
    public function __destruct() {
        fclose($this->fileHandle);
    }
}

$lines = new LineIterator($fileName);
foreach ($lines as $line) {
    // do something with $line
}
</code>

As you can see a very simple piece of code can easily become very complicated when turned into an
iterator. Generators solve this problem and allow you to implement iterators in a very straightforward
manner:

<code php>
function *getLinesFromFile($fileName) {
    if (!$fileHandle = fopen($fileName, 'r')) {
        return;
    }
    
    while (false !== $line = fgets($fileHandle)) {
        yield $line;
    }
    
    fclose($fileHandle);
}

$lines = getLinesFromFile($fileName);
foreach ($lines as $line) {
    // do something with $line
}
</code>

The code looks very similar to the array-based implementation. The main difference is that instead of pushing
values into an array the values are ''yield''ed.

Generators work by passing control back and forth between the generator and the calling code:

When you first call the generator function (''$lines = getLinesFromFile($fileName)'') the passed argument is bound,
but nothing of the code is actually executed. Instead the function directly returns a ''Generator'' object. That
''Generator'' object implements the ''Iterator'' interface and is what is eventually traversed by the ''foreach''
loop:

Whenever the ''Iterator::next()'' method is called PHP resumes the execution of the generator function until it
hits a ''yield'' expression. The value of that ''yield'' expression is what ''Iterator::current()'' then returns.

Generator methods, together with the ''IteratorAggregate'' interface, can be used to easily implement traversable
classes too:

<code php>
class Test implements IteratorAggregate {
    protected $data;
    
    public function __construct(array $data) {
        $this->data = $data;
    }
    
    public function *getIterator() {
        foreach ($this->data as $key => $value) {
            yield $key => $value;
        }
        // or whatever other traversation logic the class has
    }
}

$test = new Test(['foo' => 'bar', 'bar' => 'foo']);
foreach ($test as $k => $v) {
    echo $k, ' => ', $v, "\n";
}
</code>

Generators can also be used the other way around, i.e. instead of producing values they can also consume them. When
used in this way they are often referred to as enhanced generators, reverse generators or coroutines.

As coroutines are a rather advanced concept it is very hard to come up with not too contrived and short examples
for them. Common applications are state machines and concurrent programming (in particular cooperative multitasking).
Examples for those are rather large and as such not listed here. See http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/Coroutines.pdf
for a very nice presentation on the subject.

But to show some code at least, here is how coroutines work in principle:

<code php>
function *someCoroutine() {
    while (true) {
        // receive some data, typically in a loop
        $data = yield;
        
        doSomethingCoolWithData($data);
        
        // one can obviously also add another receive loop
        // within the outer loop (this would be one form of
        // "state" in the state machine use case)
        while (true) {
            $moreData = yield;
            
            doSomethingCoolWithMoreData($moreData);
        }
        
        // It's also possible to send data back
        yield $xyz;
        // or send an receive in one go
        $data = yield $xyz;
        
        // or pass the result on to another coroutine
        // (thus building a coroutine pipeline)
        $coroutine2->send($result);
    }
}

$coroutine = someCoroutine();
$echo->send('foo');
$echo->send('bar');
</code>

Values are sent into the generator using the ''send($value)'' method. The sent value will then be the return value of
the ''yield'' expression.

===== Specification =====

==== Recognition of generator functions ====

In Python any function which contains a ''yield'' statement is automatically a generator function and does not have
to be marked in some special way. In JavaScript (Harmony) generator functions use the ''function*'' keyword (''function''
with an asterix).

It's unclear which of the approaches is better. It seems strange that a function can completely change its behavior
based on what kind of statements it contains. Explicitely marking generator functions seems more obvious. On the other
hand, as the use of ''yield'' is enough to clearly identify a generator, the use of some special modiefer like ''*'' seems
redundant.

Furthermore using a special modifier would allow ''yield''-less generators. This by itself doesn't sound particularly useful,
but has use cases in the context of coroutines (in particular when seen in conjunction with ''yield*'' delegation). Quoting from
PEP 3152: "Finally, sometimes there is a need for a function to be a coroutine even though it does not yield anything, and in
these cases it is necessary to resort to kludges such as if 0: yield to force it to be a generator."

Thus I think that it makes sense to have some kind of marker. One option is the aforementioned asterix modifer, another one
would be a ''generator'' keyword (e.g. ''generator function range()'' or just ''generator range()''). This would have the problem
of introducing a new keyword, which I think could be already in use by people. (''yield'' on the other hand seems rather exotic).
Also the keyword would prevent the use of the class name ''Generator'' for the iterators returned by generator functions.

The use of the asterix seems somewhat consistent with the use of the ampersand ''&'' reference modifier. Similarly to how
''function &foo()'' means that the function returns by-reference, ''function *foo()'' would mean that the function "returns"
multiple values.

The only oddity that could arise is if it were allowed to specify both modifiers: ''function *&foo()'' (or ''function* &foo()''?).
It is unclear though whether that should actually be possible (see "Yield by reference" section).

Note that Facebook's implementation of this feature in HipHop does not modify the declaration signature.  Using the yield keyword is sufficient to identify a function as a generator.  It would be beneficial to keeping the implementations consistent if we followed FB's lead in this case.
==== Basic behavior ====

When a generator function is called the execution is suspended immidiately after parameter binding and a ''Generator'' object
is returned.

The ''Generator'' object implements the following interface:

<code php>
final class Generator implements Iterator {
    void  rewind();
    bool  valid();
    mixed current();
    mixed key();
    void  next();
    
    mixed send(mixed $value);
    void close();
}
</code>

If the generator is not yet at a ''yield'' statement (i.e. was just created and not yet used as an interator), then any call to
''rewind'', ''valid'', ''current'', ''key'', ''next'' or ''send'' will resume the generator until the next ''yield'' statement is
hit.

Consider this example:

<code php>
function *gen() {
    echo 'start';
    yield 'middle';
    echo 'end';
}

// Initial call does not output anything
$gen = gen();

// Call to current() resumes the generator, thus "start" is echo'd.
// Then the yield expression is hit and the string "middle" is returned
// as the result of current() and then echo'd.
echo $gen->current();

// Execution of the generator is resumed again, thus echoing "end"
$gen->next();
</code>

A nice side-effect of this behavior is that coroutines do not have to be primed with a ''next()'' call before they can be used (as
it is required in Python, where for which reason any use of a coroutine requires the use of a decorator which automatically performs
this ''next'' call.)

Apart from the behavior described above the behavior of the ''Generator'' methods is as follows:

  * ''rewind'': Generators are not rewindable, so this is just a no-op. (More in the "Rewinding a generator" section.)
  * ''valid'': Returns ''false'' if the generator has been closed, ''true'' otherwise. (More in the "Closing a generator" section.)
  * ''current'': Returns whatever was passed to ''yield'' or ''null'' if nothing was passed or the generator is already closed.
  * ''key'': Returns the yielded key or, if none was specified, an auto-incrementing key or ''null'' if the generator is already closed.
    (More in the "Yielding keys" section.)
  * ''next'': Resumes the generator (unless the generator is already closed).
  * ''send'': Sets the return value of the ''yield'' expression and resumes the generator (unless the generator is already closed).
    (More in the "Sending values" section.)
  * ''close'': Closes the generator. (More in the "Closing a generator" section.)

==== Yielding keys ====

The languages that currently implement generators don't have support for yielding keys (only values). This though is just a sideeffect
as these languages don't support keys in iterators in general. 

In PHP on the other hand keys are explicitly part of the iteration process and it thus does not make sense to not add
key-yielding support. The syntax could be analogous to that of ''foreach'' loops and ''array'' declarations:

<code php>
yield $key => $value;
</code>
    
The problem with this syntax that it would be ambiguous in array declarations and nested ''yield'' expressions:

<code php>
array(
    yield $key => $value
)
// could be
array(
    (yield $key) => $value
)
// or
array(
    (yield $key => $value)
)

yield yield $a => $b;
// could be
yield (yield $a) => $b
// or
yield (yield $a => $b)
</code>

Even though this is an absolute edge-case, the grammar still shouldn't be ambiguous in this case. It's not clear how this can
be solved. In the current implementation the ''yield $key => $value'' syntax is simply implemented as a statement instead of
an expression. This obviously is a rather bad solution to the problem and it would be preferable to find some other way to deal
with it.

Furthermore generators need to generate keys even if no key was explicitly yielded. In this case it seems reasonable to behave
the same as arrays do: Start with the key ''0'' and always increment by one. If in between an integer key which is larger than the
current auto-key is explicitly yielded, then that will be used as the starting point for new auto-keys. All other yielded keys
do not affect the auto-key mechanism.

<code php>
function *gen() {
    yield 'a';
    yield 'b';
    yield 'key' => 'c';
    yield 'd';
    yield 10 => 'e';
    yield 'f';
}

foreach (gen() as $key => $value) {
    echo $key, ' => ', $value, "\n";
}

// outputs:
0 => a
1 => b
key => c
2 => d
10 => e
11 => f
</code>
    
This is the same behavior that arrays have (i.e. if ''gen()'' instead simply returned an array with the yielded values the keys would
be same). The only difference occurs when the generator yield non-integer, but numeric keys. For arrays they are cast, for generators
the are not.

==== Rewinding a generator ====

Rewinding to some degree goes against the concept of generators, as they are mainly intended as one-time data sources that are not
supposed to be iterated another time. On the other hand, most generators probably *are* rewindable and it might make sense to allow
it. One could argue though that rewinding a generator is really bad practice (especially if the generator is doing some expensive
calculation). Allowing it to rewind would look like it is a cheap operation, just like with arrays. Also rewinding (as in jumping
back to the execution context state at the initial call to the generator) can lead to unexpected behavior, e.g. in the following case:

<code php>
function *getSomeStuff(PDOStatement $stmt) {
    foreach ($stmt as $row) {
        yield doSomethingWith($row);
    }
}
</code>
    
Here rewinding would simply result in an empty iterator as the result set is already depleted.

One solution thus could be to allow explicitely marking generators to be rewindable. E.g. one could add a ''rewindable'' function,
which makes a generator rewindable:

<code php>
$gen = rewindable(gen());
</code>
    
This function is actually already implementable in userland code (see "Cloning a generator" section.)

==== Cloning a generator ====

Generators can be cloned, thus leaving two independent ''Generator'' objects with the same state. This behavior can for example be
used to create the aforementioned ''rewindable'' function:

<code php>
class RewindableGenerator implements Iterator {
    protected $original;
    protected $current;
    
    public function __construct(Generator $generator) {
        $this->original = $generator;
        $this->current = null;
    }
    
    public function rewind() {
        if ($this->current) { $this->current->close(); }
        $this->current = clone $this->original;
        $this->current->rewind();
    }
    
    public function valid() {
        if (!$this->current) { $this->current = clone $this->original; }
        return $this->current->valid();
    }
    
    public function current() {
        if (!$this->current) { $this->current = clone $this->original; }
        return $this->current->current();
    }
    
    public function key() {
        if (!$this->current) { $this->current = clone $this->original; }
        return $this->current->key();
    }
    
    public function next() {
        if (!$this->current) { $this->current = clone $this->original; }
        $this->current->next();
    }
    
    public function send($value) {
        if (!$this->current) { $this->current = clone $this->original; }
        return $this->current->send($value);
    }
    
    public function close() {
        $this->original->close();
        if ($this->current) {
            $this->current->close();
        }
    }
}

function rewindable(Generator $generator) {
    return new RewindableGenerator($generator);
}
</code>

It can be then used as follows:

<code php>
function *xrange($start, $end, $step = 1) {
    for ($i = $start; $i <= $end; $i += $step) {
        yield $i;
    }
}

$range = rewindable(xrange(0, 5));
foreach ($range as $i) {
    echo $i, "\n";
}
foreach ($range as $i) {
    echo $i, "\n";
}
</code>

This will correctly output the 0..5 range twice.

==== Closing a generator ====

When a generator is closed it frees the suspended execution context (as well as all other held variables). After it has been closed
''valid'' will return ''false'' and both ''current'' and ''key'' will return ''null''.

A generator can be closed in three ways:

  * Explicitly calling the ''Generator::close'' method. This can be useful if you want to free used memory after you don't need the generator anymore.
  * Removing all references to the generator object. In this case the generator will be closed as part of the garbage collection process.
  * Reaching a ''return'' statement (or the end of the function) in a generator or throwing an exception from it (without catching it inside the generator).

The following resources are destructed while closing a generator:

  * The current execution context (''execute_data'')
  * Stack arguments for the generator call, and the additional execution context which is used to manage them.
  * The currently active symbol table (or the compiled variables if no symbol table is in use).
  * The current ''$this'' object.
  * If the generator is closed during a method call, the object which the method is invoked on (''EX(object)'').
  * If the generator is closed during a call, the arguments pushed to the stack.
  * Any ''foreach'' loop variables which are still alive (taken from ''brk_cont_array'').
  * The current generator key and value

Currently it can happen that temporary variables are not cleaned up properly in edge-case situations. Exceptions are also subject to
this problem: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62210. If that bug could be fixed for exceptions, then it would also be fixed for generators.

A generator cannot be closed while it is running (e.g. if ''$generator->closed()'' is called within the generator function). In this case and ''E_WARNING''
is thrown and the call is ignored.

In Python generators are closed by throwing a ''GeneratorExit'' exception into them. This is *not done* in the PHP implementation.

The exception gives the generator function a chance to clean up any resources it uses:

<code php>
function *gen() {
    $lock = getLock();
    try {
        // do some stuff
    } catch (GeneratorExitException $e) {
        releaseLock($lock);
        throw $e;
    }
    releaseLock($lock);
}
</code>

As you can see the exception allows the generator to clean up. Also note that the exception has to be rethrown. This way it is ensured that
the generator does not simply resume execution, but really does terminate.

As PHP does not support ''finally'' blocks which have strict must-run semantics and there are other simple ways to enforce resource cleanup
(e.g. destructors) this behavior is not implemented in PHP.

===== Patch =====

A working, but not yet complete implementation can be found at https://github.com/nikic/php-src/tree/addGeneratorsSupport.

===== Performance =====

You can find a small micro benchmark at https://gist.github.com/2975796. It compares several ways of iterating ranges:

  * Using generators (''xrange'')
  * Using iterators (''RangeIterator'')
  * Using arrays implemented in userland (''urange'')
  * Using arrays implemented internally (''range'')

For large ranges generators are consistently faster; about four times faster than an iterator implementation and even 40% faster than the native ''range'' implementation.

For small ranges (around one hundred elements) the variance of the results is rather high, but from multiple runs it seems that in this case generators are slightly slower
than the native implementation, but still faster than the iterator variant.

The tests were run on a Ubuntu VM, so I'm not exactly sure how representative they are.
