====== PHP RFC: Don't automatically unserialize Phar metadata outside getMetadata() ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2020-07-07 (use today's date here)
  * Author: Tyson Andre <tandre@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion

  * Implementation: Pending

===== Introduction =====

In 2018, various vulnerabilities were found in php web frameworks due to the phar stream wrappers. A call such as ''%%file_exists("phar://...somepath.extension/file/within/phar.ext")%%'' will lead to unserializing the metadata found in the phar. As https://php.net/unserialize notes, "unserialization can result in code being loaded and executed due to object instantiation and autoloading, and a malicious user may be able to exploit this."

Various blog posts have been written explaining the resulting vulnerabilities,
such as https://www.ixiacom.com/company/blog/exploiting-php-phar-deserialization-vulnerabilities-part-1

===== Proposal =====

Don't unserialize the metadata automatically when a phar is opened by php. Only unserialize the metadata if ''%%Phar->getMetadata()%%'' or ''%%PharFile->getMetadata()%%'' is called directly.

Additionally, add an ''$allowed_classes'' parameter to both getMetadata() implementations, defaulting to the current behavior of allowing any classes (true). This will be passed to the call to ''unserialize()'' performed internally.

This implements one possible solution for https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76774

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Any side effects from ''%%__wakeup()%%'', ''%%__destruct()%%'', etc. that were triggered during/after unserialization of metadata when the phar is loaded will stop happening, and will only happen when ''getMetadata()'' is directly called.

Eliminating the side effects is the goal of this RFC, for security reasons. Typical phars use scalars and associative arrays for any metadata, and many phars don't need metadata at all.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

8.0

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
This affects stream wrapper calls such as file_exists(), as well as direct calls to ''%%Phar->getMetadata()%%''
Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values: On
  * php.ini-development values: On
  * php.ini-production values: On

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Yes/No, requiring 2/3 majority to stop automatically unserializing metadata.

===== Rejected Features =====

I'd considered continuing to call unserialize() all of the time to validate phars earlier, but with ''allowed_classes=[]'' instead (controlled by an ini setting). This seemed like an unnecessary ini setting that could be avoided by just not automatically loading the metadata.
