====== PHP RFC: Multibyte Char Hnadling ======
  * Version: 0.2

  * Author: Yasuo Ohgaki, yohgaki@ohgaki.net 
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/multibyte_char_handling

===== Introduction =====

For example, addslashes()/stripslashes() has vulnerability that allows PHP script execution and DoS under certain environment via char encoding based attack. Counter measure using php_mblen() is proposed at first in security ML. However, php_mblen() is locale dependent and unreliable. Therefore, this is proposed and created RFC to decide.

Proper and secure char encoding handling is mandatory for application to work correctly. However, current PHP lacks default multibyte char handling feature. As a result, escapeshellarg()/escapeshellcmd()/fgetcsv() rely on locale based multibyte char handling for security and proper operation. Currently, addslahses()/ver_export()/stripslashes() lacks proper multibyte char handling. 

escapeshellarg()/escapeshellcmd()/fgetcsv() uses locale based multibyte char handling. i.e. php_mblem() Although this approach works mostly, it has several disadvantages.

  * Locale is not reliable and has issues on some locale, such as Turkish locale.
  * Locale is not visible for application programmers. Most developers just ignores locale.

New mbstring functions are added for users that are affected by this issue so that they can simply rename functions.


===== Proposal =====

PHP, including released versions, needs secure addslashes()/var_export()/stripslashes(). 

==== Add mb_addslashes()/mb_var_export()/mb_stripslashes() to released versions ====

For PHP 5.3 and up, add mb_add_slashes()/mb_var_export()/mb_strip_slashes() has encoding option.

  string mb_add_slashes(string $str [, string $encoding=internal_encoding])
  string mb_var_export(mixed $var [, bool $return=FALSE [, string $encoding=internal_encoding]])
  string mb_strip_slashes(string $str [, $encoding=internal_encoding])

==== Add mb version of function uses php_mblen() ====

For PHP 5.3 and up, add mb_escape_shell_arg()/mb_secape_shell_cmd()/mb_fget_csv()/etc that have extra encoding parameter like mb_add_slashes().

  * mb_escape_shell_arg
  * mb_escape_shsell_cmd
  * functions/methods use php_fgetcsv API http://lxr.php.net/search?q=php_fgetcsv&project=PHP_5_5

Reference
  * http://lxr.php.net/search?q=php_mblen&defs=&refs=&path=&hist=&project=PHP_5_5

==== mbstring usage and implementation ====

For PHP 5.5 and less, all changes done in mbstring.

For PHP 5.6 and up, mbstring is compiled by default as non shared extension. Introduce refactored code for PHP 5.6

mbstring is rather large module. Therefore, it is better to be able to build PHP without mbstring. Any function uses mbstring feature use "#if", so that PHP could be built without mbstring.

mbstring functions have history of remain insecure when single byte version of function's issue has been fixed. e.g. mb_prase_str(), mb_send_mail() To avoid this issue, mbstring function calls multibyte aware version ext/standard APIs.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

  * PHP 5.3 and up - Introduce additional mb_*() functions
  * PHP 5.6 and up - Compile mbstring by default as non shared extension.

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

  * PHP 5.6 and up - Compiles mbstring by default. 
  * PHP 5.6 and up - ext/standard has multibyte aware version of internal string API.

===== Open Issues =====

  * Use of INI for overriding single byte string functions by mbstring functions.
  * Location of multibyte aware internal API (mbstring or standard)

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Yas/No

===== Patches and Tests =====

  * Prepared for review after vote.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
