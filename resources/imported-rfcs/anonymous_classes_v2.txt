====== PHP RFC: Anonymous Classes v2 ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2014-10-22
  * Author: Joe Watkins
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/anonymous_classes_v2

===== Introduction =====
We have looked at anonymous classes before http://wiki.php.net/rfc/anonymous_classes

The patch is only a tiny bit different, moving constructor arguments to the position where most expect them.

Many many use cases were put forward by the community for the last RFC and they all still apply.

===== Proposal =====

Some example code ...

<code php>
<?php
class A {}

trait ArrayAccessor {
    public function offsetSet($offset, $data) { return $this->{$this->name}[$offset] = $data; }
    public function offsetGet($offset)        { return $this->{$this->name}[$offset]; }
    public function offsetUnset($offset)      { return $this->{$this->name}[$offset]; }
    public function offsetExists($offset)     { return isset($this->{$this->name}[$offset]); }
    
    public function setArray($name, $member) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->
            {$this->name} = $member;
    }
    
    private $name;
}

$test = new class(["hello", "world"])
            extends A implements ArrayAccess {
    use ArrayAccessor;
    
    public function __construct($greeting) {
        $this->setArray("data", $greeting);
    }
    
    protected $data;
};

var_dump($test,
         $test instanceof ArrayAccess,
         $test instanceof A,
         class_uses($test),
         $test[0], $test[1]);
?>

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Existing extensions performing magic or analysis of opcodes may require revision.

==== To Opcache ====
Opcache might need some revision, and a new optimization may also be possible. Discussion with dmitry required.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

A straight yes/no vote should be conducted.

A 2/3 majority is required for the RFC to pass.
