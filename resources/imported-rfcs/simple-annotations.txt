====== PHP RFC: Simple Annotations ======

  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-05-13
  * Author: Rasmus Schultz, rasmus@mindplay.dk
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/simple-annotations

===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes the introduction of simple value annotations - arbitrary meta-data values applicable to classes and class members, obtainable via the reflection API.

As an alternative proposal to [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes|attributes]], this proposal aims to fully leverage existing language features, in order to provide more flexibility, lessen the learning curve, and expose meta-data in a manner that is more immediately useful, without having to build any run-time facilities.

Compared with annotation systems such as [[https://github.com/doctrine/annotations|Doctrine Annotations]], this proposal does not attempt to define or enforce any domain rules - it does not define inheritance semantics, rules about applicable source-code elements, or any other rules; these can be defined and implemented by userland packages.

===== Proposal =====

The proposed syntax of a single annotation is extremely simple:

<code>
"<<" <php-expression> ">>"
</code>

Any valid PHP expression is a valid annotation.

Any number of annotations may be placed in front of any of the following applicable declarations:

  * ''class'', ''trait'' and ''interface'' declarations
  * ''function'' and property declarations in classes/traits/interfaces
  * function and method argument declarations
  * anonymous ''function'' and ''class'' declarations (and their members)

For example:

<code php>
class Table
{

    public function __construct($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}
</code>

Annotations are internally collected, for each annotated class or member, in a list which can be obtained via reflection.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 7.x.
