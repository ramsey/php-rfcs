====== PHP RFC: 64 bit platform improvements for string length and integer in zval ======
  * Version: 1.8
  * Date: 2013-12-05
  * Authors: Anatol Belski <ab@php.net>, Matt Ficken <mattficken@php.net>, Stephen A. Zarkos <szarkos@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion


===== Introduction =====

Current PHP zval datatype implementation uses //long// datatype to handle signed integer and //int// datatype to handle string length. The most 64 bit capable platforms PHP is used on are **LP64** (Linux/most Unix-like), **LLP64** (Windows), **ILP64** (SPARC64). The data model used for the relevant datatypes on those platforms looks as follows

^  ^ string size ^ signed integer ^
^ Platform ^ int ^ long ^
| LP64 | 32 bit | 64 bit |
| LLP64 | 32 bit | 32 bit |
| ILP64 | 64 bit | 64 bit |
\\ 
Regarding PHP that means today, even on 64 bit platforms the following features lack on consistency

  * handling of strings >= 2^31
  * handling of 64 bit integers
  * LFS support
  * handling of numeric 64 bit hash keys
\\ 
Thus, the current situation contains a road block on overall consistent 64 bit platforms support and further improvement of PHP. To bring everything inline, dynamic types model is suggested to be used. Besides the platform inconsistency elimination, this will enable several further moves (see the Future scope). Performance improvements for 64 bit platforms, just to name one, could be then the subject of a new RFC and would have the base for the further development.

===== Proposal =====

The following datatypes are suggested for use in zval

^ Platform ^ string size ^ signed integer ^
| LP64 | //size_t// | //int64_t// |
| LLP64 |  //size_t// | //<nowiki>__int64</nowiki>//  |
| ILP64 | //size_t// | //int64_t// |

\\

Those datatypes are guaranteed to be 64 bit which makes PHP work consistent on any 64 bit platforms. The usage of this datatypes is integrated into the appropriate places across PHP. 

For the consistent LFS support, a set of portable datatypes and macros was invented and integrated.

For consistent 64 bit numeric hash keys support, the appropriate 64 bit //unsigned// was integrated.

The usage of //long// datatype continues on 32 bit platforms, the only change there is the usage of //unsigned// for the string length.

No further configure options are needed, the platform and compiler will be automatically recognized and an appropriate set of datatypes and macros will be activated.

==== New portable datatypes ====

^ Old datatype ^ New datatype ^ Comment ^ 
| int, uint, zend_uint, size_t, long | zend_size_t | Overall datatype to handle object size and string length in zval. Aliased as php_size_t in php.h |
| long | zend_int_t | Overall datatype to handle integers in zval.  Aliased with php_int_t in php.h |
| ulong, unsigned long | zend_uint_t | Overall datatype to handle numeric hash indexes. Aliased with php_uint_t in php.h |
| off_t, _off_t | zend_off_t | Overall datatype to handle file offsets. Corresponding portable macros have to be used. |
| struct stat, struct _stat, struct _stat64 | zend_stat_t | Overall datatype to handle the FS info. Corresponding portable macros have to be used. |  
\\

==== New portable macros for LFS support ====
^ function(s) ^ Alias ^ Comment ^ 
| stat, _stat64 | zend_stat | for use with zend_stat_t |
| fstat, _fstat64 | zend_fstat | for use with zend_stat_t |
| lseek, _lseeki64 | zend_lseek | for use with zend_off_t |
| ftell, _ftelli64 | zend_ftell | for use with zend_off_t |
| fseek, _fseeki64 | zend_fseek | for use with zend_off_t |
\\

==== New portable macros for integers ====
^ function(s) ^ Alias ^ Comment ^ 
| snprintf with "%ld" or "%lld", _ltoa_s, _i64toa_s | ZEND_ITOA | for use with zend_int_t|
| atol, atoll, _atoi64 | ZEND_ATOI | for use with zend_int_t |
| strtol, strtoll, _strtoi64 | ZEND_STRTOL| for use with zend_int_t |
| strtoul, strtoull, _strtoui64 | ZEND_STRTOUL|for use with zend_int_t |
| abs, llabs, _abs64 | ZEND_ABS |for use with zend_int_t |
| - | ZEND_INT_MAX | Aliased with PHP_INT_MAX in php.h, replaces LONG_MAX where appropriate |
| - | ZEND_INT_MIN | Aliased with PHP_INT_IN in php.h, replaces LONG_MIN where appropriate |
| - | ZEND_UINT_MAX | ULONG_MAX |
| - | SIZEOF_ZEND_INT | Replaces SIZEOF_ZEND_LONG where appropriate | 
| - | ZEND_SIZE_MAX | Max value of zend_size_t |
\\

==== Semantical macro renamings ====

^ Old ^ New ^ Comment ^
| Z_STRLEN | Z_STRSIZE | as well the whole Z_STRLEN_* family |
| IS_LONG | IS_INT | |
| RETURN_LONG | RETURN_INT | |
| RETVAL_LONG | RETVAL_INT | |
| Z_LVAL | Z_IVAL | as well the whole Z_LVAL_* family |
| LITERAL_LONG | LITERAL_INT | |
| REGISTER_LONG_CONSTANT | REGISTER_INT_CONSTANT | |
| REGISTER_MAIN_LONG_CONSTANT | REGISTER_MAIN_INT_CONSTANT | |
| ZEND_SIGNED_MULTIPLY_LONG | ZEND_SIGNED_MULTIPLY_INT | |
| ... | ... | |

Generally speaking, every occurence mentioning //long// in macros or function names should be replaced with a corresponding neutral keyword, suggested "int", in further like "lval" with "ival", etc.

**NOTE**: the macro renamings change is up to the vote. Depending on the vote results, the macro renamings can be reverted and will become a topic of one of the later cleanup RFC.

==== Accepting values from userland with zend_parse_parameters() ====

^ Old ^ New ^ Comment ^
| "s" | "S" | accept string argument, the length has to be declared as php_size_t (or zend_size_t) |
| "p" | "P" | accept path argument, the length has to be declared as php_size_t (or zend_size_t) |
| "l" | "i" | to accept integer argument, the internal var has to be declared as php_int_t (inside PHP) or zend_int_t (inside Zend) |
| "L" | "I" | to accept integer argument with range check, the internal var has to be declared as php_int_t (inside PHP) or zend_int_t (inside Zend)|

**NOTE**: please take in account the voting option for retaining compatibility with old specs. Should the availability of the older specs be voted positive, the patch will be extended with them as aliases. The actual removal will be then the subject of the later cleanup RFC.
\\

==== printf formats ====

New printf modifier 'p' was implemented to platform independently output php_int_t datatype. That modifier can be used with 'd', 'u', 'x' and 'o' printf format specs with spprintf, snprintf and the wrapping printf implementations.

=== Portable macros to use with printf ==

^ Format spec ^ Macros ^ Comment ^ 
| %I64d, "%" PRId64, %ld | ZEND_INT_FMT | for use with zend_int_t |
| %I64u, %lu | ZEND_UINT_FMT | for use with zend_uint_t |

Any of the introduced new datatypes can be used with the appropriate format spec.


\\

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

  * //long// and //int// in //zval//have to be replaced with the new integer datatypes
  * code working with hashes and arrays has to use php_uint_t
  * code working with filesystem objects has to use appropriate portable macros and datatypes

**NOTE** the items below are to be considered in the vote, depending on it the patch will be changed. 
  * 'l', 'L', 's', 'p' parameter formats aren't available anymore
  * Z_STRLEN* macros aren't available anymore
  * *LONG* macros aren't available anymore

===== Proposed PHP Version =====

PHP 5.6


===== Impacts =====

  * possible collisions with dependency libraries using 32 bit integer datatypes (range checks needed)
  * existing extensions have to adapt zend_parsing_parameters() format
  * existing extensions have to use new APIs and macros for string length and integer
  * in the user space some function names need to be adapted on the new semantics, for instance long2ip() should be int2ip()


===== Open Issues =====

Some dead SAPIs are present in the core. They was not ported. A decision based on whether the authors are willing to support them has to be met. Then porting or removal of those SAPIs can be scheduled. The separate RFC https://wiki.php.net/rfc/removal_of_dead_sapis was created to handle this issue.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

It has to do with squeezing anything possible from the 64 bit platforms, for maximal PHP benefit. No real features are going to be changed, removed or added to the PHP language.

===== Migration path for PECL extensions =====

Tutorial, tools and compatibility header to ease the migration of the PECL extensions are available [[http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=tree;f=compat;hb=refs/heads/str_size_and_int64 | here]] . The goal is to make the same source in the new semantic compatible with older PHP versions.

=== Example on accepting parameters with zpp ===

<code c>
	php_int_t i0, i1;
	char *s0, p0;
	php_size_t s0_len, p0_len;

	if(zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, "iISP", &i0, &i1, &s0, &s0_len, &p0, &p0_len) == FAILURE) {
		return;
	}
</code>

=== Example on portable usage of printf specs ===

<code c>
	php_int_t i0;

	if(zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, "i"), &i0) == FAILURE) {
		return;
	}

	if (INT_MAX < i0 || INT_MIN > i0) {
		php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, "Value '" ZEND_INT_FMT "' is out of range", i0);
		return;
	}
</code>

=== Example proper check of string size ===

<code c>
	char *s0;
	php_size_t s0_len;
	php_int_t max_len;

	if(zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, "Si", &s0, &s0_len, &max_len) == FAILURE) {
		return;
	}

	if (max_len >= 0 && s0_len > max_len) {
		return;
	}
</code>
\\

===== Future Scope =====

  * with further tweaks - enabling 64 bit integer even on 32 bit platform
  * in far perspective - easier to implement 128 bit support
  * in near perspective - excellent base for 64 bit performance optimization
  * easier integration on rarely used platforms

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

==== Vote 1 ====

  * merge str_size_and_int64 branch into 5.6: yes/no

==== Vote 2 ====

  * keep the old macro names for LONG<>INT, STRLEN<>STRSIZE, etc. : yes/no

==== Vote 3 ====

  * keep zpp specs "lLsp" as aliases to "iISP": yes/no
