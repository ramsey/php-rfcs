====== PHP RFC: Range checks for external libary APIs in 64-bit builds ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2015-08-24
  * Author: Anatol Belski, ab@php.net
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

PHP binds many external libraries with the core extensions. Several libraries like libxml2, openssl, etc. require exact int data types with their signatures. Built for 64-bit for several platforms like LLP64 or LP64, the int data type is still 32-bit. This means, the user land input might overflow the ranges foreseen in those external libraries signatures, which can lead to any possible negative impacts from functionality to security.

Other aspects of the mentioned issue are internal PHP functions not requiring 64-bit functionality so behaving same way on 64-bit when having possibly non 64-bit argument types in signatures. Yet another impact might be also comparison of variables with 64- and 32-bit, signed and unsigned types. 

==== Proposed macros for 32-bit int checks ====

<code c>
#if SIZEOF_INT == SIZEOF_ZEND_LONG
# define ZEND_LONG_INT_OVFL(zl) (0)
# define ZEND_LONG_INT_UDFL(zl) (0)
#else
# define ZEND_LONG_INT_OVFL(zlong) ((zlong) > (zend_long)INT_MAX)
# define ZEND_LONG_INT_UDFL(zlong) ((zlong) < (zend_long)INT_MIN)
#endif

#define ZEND_SIZE_T_INT_OVFL(size) ((size) > (size_t)INT_MAX)

</code>

==== Example of an affected places ====

Here is the real case from the current code base, the irrelevant declarations and code are removed

<code c>
PHP_FUNCTION(simplexml_load_string)
{
    char           *data;
    size_t          data_len;
    zend_long       options = 0;

.........................

    if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "s|C!lsb", &data, &data_len, &ce, &options, &ns, &ns_len, &isprefix) == FAILURE) {
        return;
    }

    docp = xmlReadMemory(data, data_len, NULL, NULL, options);

.........................

}
</code>

The proposed way to fix it using ZPP
<code c>
PHP_FUNCTION(simplexml_load_string)
{
    char           *data;
    int            data_len;
    int            options = 0;

.........................

    if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "q|C!isb", &data, &data_len, &ce, &options, &ns, &ns_len, &isprefix) == FAILURE) {
        return;
    }

    docp = xmlReadMemory(data, data_len, NULL, NULL, options);

.........................

}
</code>

The proposed way to fix it using the overflow check macro
<code c>
PHP_FUNCTION(simplexml_load_string)
{
    char           *data;
    size_t          data_len;
    zend_long       options = 0;

.........................

    if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "s|C!lsb", &data, &data_len, &ce, &options, &ns, &ns_len, &isprefix) == FAILURE) {
        return;
    }

    if (ZEND_LONG_INT_OVFL(options)) {
          RETURN_FALSE;
    }
    if (ZEND_SIZE_T_INT_OVFL(data_len)) {
         RETURN_FALSE;
    }


    docp = xmlReadMemory(data, data_len, NULL, NULL, options);

.........................

}

===== Proposal =====

It is suggested to implement two additional formats for ZPP, that are explicitly require

  * strings with 32-bit length
  * 32-bit integers

on affected platforms only. In addition, it is suggested to implement a set of macros for range checks and comparison.

The mentioned implementations won't affect places where no range overflows can happen. The checks functionality will be excluded automatically at the compile time on the platform/build combinations where it does not make sense. For example on the platforms like ILP64 these checks make no sense.

All the extensions linking to the libraries or places using internal functions of the mentioned kind have to be adapted with the new ZPP and possibly macro handling.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Several new warnings or harder error handling might be introduced with the new range checks. This 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
7.1

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Only positive impact with more precise argument checks.

==== To Opcache ====
No. Opcache doesn't link to any of the external libraries to be handled by this RFC.

==== New Constants ====
No.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
No.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
The current usage when no overflows happen is not affected. Only what is affected are the edge cases explained in the introduction.

===== Future Scope =====
This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

yes/no.

===== Patches and Tests =====
TBD.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
