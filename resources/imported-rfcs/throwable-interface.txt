====== PHP RFC: Throwable Interface ======

  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
PHP 7 has introduced exceptions as a replacement for fatal or recoverable fatal errors. These exceptions do not extend ''Exception'', but instead extend a new class ''BaseException'' and are named ''EngineException'', ''TypeException'', and ''ParseException''. These 

The current exception hierarchy implemented for PHP 7 has a naming scheme that is unintuitive and will lead to confusion, especially for newer users.

Example:
<code php>
function add(int $left, int $right) {
    return $left + $right;
};

try {
    echo add('left', 'right');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle or log exception.
}
</code>

The code above will not catch the ''TypeException'' thrown due to the mis-matched type-hint, resulting in the following message to the user:

<code>
Fatal error: Uncaught TypeException: Argument 1 passed to add() must be of the type integer, string given
</code>

The reason that an object named ''TypeException'' would not be caught by ''catch (Exception $e)'' is not obvious.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes a change to the exception hierarchy for PHP 7. This proposal is based on the [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1274|Throwable pull request]] created by Sebastian Bergmann and has been fully implemented in the [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1284|Throwable Interface pull request]].

  * ''interface Throwable''
    * ''Exception implements Throwable''
    * ''Error implements Throwable'' (Replaces ''EngineException'')
      * ''TypeError extends Error''
      * ''ParseError extends Error''

''BaseException'' will be removed. In order for an object to be thrown, it must implement the ''Throwable'' interface.

The ''Throwable'' interface specifies the following methods:
  * ''getMessage()''
  * ''getCode()''
  * ''getFile()''
  * ''getLine()''
  * ''getTrace()''
  * ''getTraceAsString()''
  * ''__toString()''

While both ''Exception'' and ''Error'' are implemented using the same code in the interpreter, the ''Throwable'' interface does not preclude future classes from implementing the interface differently.

''catch (Error $e)'' and ''catch (Throwable $e)'' may respectively be used to catch ''Error'' objects or any ''Throwable'' (current or future) object. Users should be discouraged from catching ''Error'' objects object except for logging or cleanup purposes as ''Error'' objects represent coding problems that should be fixed rather than runtime conditions that may be handled.

=== Error Name Choice ===

The name ''Error'' was chosen to correspond with PHP's other errors. Non-fatal errors will issue warnings and notices, while fatal errors are thrown. While this may also cause some confusion for users, other name choices for the class such as ''Failure'' seem equally problematic. It is likely that users would search for 'Uncaught Error' when searching for the reason behind the problem and would minimize overlap with with warning and notice messages. Users may even wish to use ''set_error_handler()'' to throw objects extending ''Error'' in their code for any type of error.

=== AssertionException ===

If this RFC is accepted, ''AssertionException'' should instead extend ''Error'' and be renamed to ''AssertionError'' as suggested in the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/expectations|Expectations RFC]].

===== Proposed PHP Version =====
PHP 7

===== Backwards Compatibility =====
''Throwable'', ''Error'', ''TypeError'', and ''ParseError'' will no longer be available in the global namespace.

===== Patch =====
A patch for this RFC is available at [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1284]].

The patch prevents user classes from implementing ''Throwable'', preventing users from creating their own throwable branches, ensuring only ''Exception'' and ''Error'' instances can be thrown. ''Error'' instances can be created and extended by users, allowing users to create throwable ''Error'' objects to create their own fatal errors.
