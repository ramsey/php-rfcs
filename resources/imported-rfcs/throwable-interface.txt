====== PHP RFC: Throwable Interface ======

===== Introduction =====
PHP 7 has introduced exceptions as a replacement for fatal or recoverable fatal errors (see the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_exceptions_for_php7|Exceptions in the Engine RFC]]). These exceptions do not extend ''Exception'', but instead extend a new class ''BaseException'' and are named ''EngineException'', ''TypeException'', and ''ParseException''. These classes have a naming scheme that is unintuitive and will lead to confusion, especially for newer users.

**Since the decision was made to separate the exception branches, then that separation should be clear instead of obfuscated by similar class names.**

Example:

<code php>
function add(int $left, int $right) {
    return $left + $right;
}

try {
    echo add('left', 'right');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle or log exception.
}
</code>

The code above will not catch the ''TypeException'' thrown due to the mis-matched type-hint, resulting in the following message to the user:

<code>
Fatal error: Uncaught TypeException: Argument 1 passed to add() must be of the type integer, string given
</code>

The reason an object named ''TypeException'' would not be caught by ''catch (Exception $e)'' is not obvious. The ''Exception'' suffix implies that ''TypeException'' extends ''Exception''. If the name of the thrown class was ''TypeError'' it would be much clearer that the class does not extend ''Exception'', but rather is part of a different class hierarchy that must be caught separately.

To catch the ''TypeException'', the user must write code like this:

<code php>
function add(int $left, int $right) {
    return $left + $right;
}

try {
    echo add('left', 'right');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle exception
} catch (TypeException $e) { // Appears to descend from Exception
    // Log error and end gracefully
}
</code>

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes a change to the exception hierarchy for PHP 7. This proposal is based on the [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1274|Throwable pull request]] created by Sebastian Bergmann and has been fully implemented in the [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1284|Throwable Interface pull request]].

  * ''interface Throwable''
    * ''Exception implements Throwable''
    * ''Error implements Throwable'' (Replaces ''EngineException'')
      * ''TypeError extends Error''
      * ''ParseError extends Error''

''BaseException'' will be removed. Note that ''ParseError'' extends ''Error'', whereas ''ParseException'' extended ''BaseException''.

Only objects that implement the ''Throwable'' interface can be thrown. The proposed patch does not allow userland classes to implement the ''Throwable'' interface. Instead all classes declared in userland must extend one of the existing exception classes.

The ''Throwable'' interface specifies the following methods:
  * ''getMessage()''
  * ''getCode()''
  * ''getFile()''
  * ''getLine()''
  * ''getTrace()''
  * ''getTraceAsString()''
  * ''__toString()''

While both ''Exception'' and ''Error'' are implemented using the same code in the interpreter, the ''Throwable'' interface does not preclude future classes from implementing the interface differently or from the implementation of ''Exception'' and ''Error'' to be different in the future.

''catch (Error $e)'' and ''catch (Throwable $e)'' may be used to catch respectively ''Error'' objects or any ''Throwable'' (current or future) object. Users should generally be discouraged from catching ''Error'' objects except for logging or cleanup purposes as ''Error'' objects represent coding problems that should be fixed rather than runtime conditions that may be handled.

After this proposed change, it would be clearer in the example above that another catch block is needed if the user wishes to log errors and end the script gracefully.

<code php>
function add(int $left, int $right) {
    return $left + $right;
}

try {
    echo add('left', 'right');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle exception
} catch (Error $e) { // Clearly a different type of object
    // Log error and end gracefully
}
</code>


=== Error Name Choice ===

The name ''Error'' was chosen to correspond with PHP's other errors. Non-fatal errors detected by PHP will continue to trigger warnings and notices, while fatal errors are thrown as ''Error'' exceptions.

Conceptually both of these conditions are error conditions detected by PHP. The only difference is that for some errors the execution of the script can continue from where the error occurred; for others it is not possible for execution to continue from the place where the error occurred, and so instead an exception must be thrown.

Users may wish to use ''set_error_handler()'' to throw objects extending ''Error'' in their code for non-fatal types of error.

While this name may also cause some confusion for users, other name choices such as ''Failure'' do not seem appropriate. It is likely that users would use the term 'Uncaught Error' when searching, minimizing overlap with with non-fatal error messages.

=== AssertionException ===

If this RFC is accepted, ''AssertionException'' should instead extend ''Error'' and be renamed to ''AssertionError'' as suggested in the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/expectations|Expectations RFC]].

===== Proposed PHP Version =====
PHP 7

===== Backwards Compatibility =====
''Throwable'', ''Error'', ''TypeError'', and ''ParseError'' will be built-in interfaces/classes and so it will no longer be possible for users to create classes with those exact names. It will still be possible for those names to be used within a non-global namespace.

===== Patch =====
A patch for this RFC is available at [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1284]].

===== Voting =====
A majority of 50%+1 is required to approve this RFC.

Please remember that this vote is not about creating separate exception branches, as that decision was made in the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_exceptions_for_php7|Exceptions in the Engine RFC]]. This vote is about having short, concise, more intuitive names that clarify the separation rather than obfuscating it. ''Throwable'' and ''Error'' make stacked catch blocks cleaner with more obvious behavior. Voting no means keeping ''BaseException'', ''EngineException'', etc. that do not extend ''Exception'', but are named as though they do.
