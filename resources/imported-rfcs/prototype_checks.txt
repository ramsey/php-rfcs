===== Introduction =====

Past discussions on the mailing lists have shed some light on the various ways we handle prototype checks and what may be done to improve PHP in that area.
This RFC summarizes the current state (5.3/5.4) of prototype checks and possible improvements to it

===== Prototype checks =====

Prototype checks occur in different contexts:

==== Implementing abstract method ====

The prototype is checked with current normal rules (see Current rules). Any mismatch with current rules generates a FATAL error.

==== Implementing interface method ====

The prototype is checked with current normal rules (see Current rules). Any mismatch with current rules generates a FATAL error.

==== Overriding existing method ====

The prototype is checked with current normal rules (see Current rules). Any mismatch with current rules generates a STRICT error.

===== Current rules =====

This part specifies what is currently considered as a compatible signature:
==== Allowed ====
=== Adding new optional arguments ===

  function foo($a)
becomes
  function foo($a, $b = 42)

=== Adding a return-by-ref ===

  function foo($a)
becomes
  function &foo($a)
