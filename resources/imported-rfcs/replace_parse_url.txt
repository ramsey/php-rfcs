====== PHP RFC: Create RFC Compliant URL Parser ======
  * Version: 0.3
  * Date: 2016-10-04
  * Author: David Walker (dave@mudsite.com)
  * Proposed version: PHP 7.2+
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/replace_parse_url

===== Introduction =====
This RFC came about for an attempt to resolve [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72811|Bug #72811]].  In the attempt, discussion shifted from trying to patch the current implementation of ''parse_url()'' to more generally replacing the current one.  The discussion then shifted to the inability to remove ''parse_url()'' due to BC issues.  Ideas formed on creating an immutable class that will take a URL and parse it, exposing the pieces by getters.

The current implementation of ''parse_url()'' makes a bunch of exceptions to [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986|RFC 3986]].  I do not know if these are conscious exceptions, or, if ''parse_url()'' was never based off of the RFC.  After raising this RFC, I was alerted that the RFC, is complimented by [[https://url.spec.whatwg.org|WHATWG]] spec on URLs.  The aim of WHATWG is to combine RFC 3986 and [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987|RFC 3987]].  However, WHATWG is a "Living Standard" which makes it subject to change, however frequent.  Although it does some good combining the two RFC's, the complexities to have a single PHP parser that would require constant maintaining to adhere to the evolving standard is not exactly practical.

So, this RFC proposes creating a new parser that adheres to the two RFC's.  In doing so, if PHP is compiled with mbstring support, would be able to properly support multibyte characters in a URL.

===== Proposal =====
<file php>
<?php

class URL {
    public function  __construct(string $url, string|URL $base);
    
    /**
     * $input - The string to be parsed
     * $base - (optional) If $url is relative, this is what it is relative to
     * $encoding_override - (optional) we assume $url is a UTF-8 encoded string, you may change it here
     * $url - (optional) A URL object that should be modified by the parsing of $input.  The return value will be this variable as well
     * $state_override - (optional) begin parting the $input from a specific state.
     */
    static public function parse(string $input[, URL $base[, int $encoding_override[, URL $url[, int $state_override]]]]) : URL;
    
    public function getScheme() : ?string;
    public function getUsername() : ?string;
    public function getPassword() : ?string;
    public function getHostname() : ?string;
    public function getPort() : ?int;
    public function getPath() : ?string;
    public function getQuery() : ?string;
    public function getFragment() : ?string;
    
    public function getAll() : array;
}

</file>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Existing Extensions ====
standard

===== Open Issues =====
  * Deprecate ''parse_url()''?  Try and push people into using the new URLParser class.
  * Should ''parse_url()'' have a sunset date of PHP8, or PHP9?

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Requires 2/3

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
