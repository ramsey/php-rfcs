====== PHP RFC: Replace parse_url() ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-10-03
  * Author: David Walker (dave@mudsite.com)
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/replace_parse_url

===== Introduction =====
This RFC came about for an attempt to resolve [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72811|Bug #72811]].  In the attempt, discussion shifted from trying to patch the current implementation of ''parse_url()'' to replacing it with an re2c based parser.  The current implementation of ''parse_url()'' does not respect [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986|RFC 3986]] with regard to most of the components of a URL.  The bug in question noted that

<file php>
<?php
var_dump(parse_url("127.0.0.1:80", PHP_URL_HOST));

/* Outputs:
string(9) "127.0.0.1"
*/
</file>

While we all may agree that this is sensible, and totally expected, it is actually a lie.  That is not how the RFC defines how that string should be interpreted.  It should parse as a single PATH element ''string(12) "127.0.0.1:80"''.  Why?  Well the RFC defines the ''hier-part'', which contains the host portion, of the URI to be after a double-slash, to which the example lacks.  This would result in the ''path-noscheme'' portion of the parsing to match beginning at the ''1'' and fill the path until a ''?'' or ''#'' is found.

===== Proposal =====
The proposal of this RFC is two fold.  One, replace the current parser used for ''parse_url()'' to utilize re2c.  Two, ensure ''parse_url()'' more closely follows the RFC.  The function signature will not change, however, the return value will be more consistent.

The function can return
  * An array consisting of each component of the URI found.
  * A string|int of the component requested by the 2nd argument
  * NULL when we can not parse the URI, or, the component request contains no value

===== Discussion Points =====
==== RFC Break ====
I do make a single exception and break with the RFC in one place.  The RFC does not permit curly-braces within a query component.  For instance ''http://example.net/index.php?q={fullname}'', where the RFC would define the path as being ''q='', I don't feel this is accurate as ''{'' and ''}'' are not special markers within an URI and should otherwise be treated as part of the string.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Many of the tests that were developed for the current implementation of ''parse_url()'' have been changed to reflect a more standards compliant test.  This change will break anyone who is using the function with a non-standards compliant URI format.  This is the most problematic in terms of a BC break.  By this point, many people who use ''parse_url()'' might expect it to work in a, lets say, forgiving manner.  The example provided in the bug report is a perfect example of what I feel is a common use case of this function which will no longer act in a standards compliant method.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.2, or later

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Existing Extensions ====
standard 

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Vote to replace ''parse_url()'' with an re2c parser, and require standard compliant URI formats.
Requires 2/3

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
