====== PHP RFC: Replace parse_url() ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-10-03
  * Author: David Walker (dave@mudsite.com)
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/replace_parse_url

===== Introduction =====
This RFC came about for an attempt to resolve [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72811|Bug #72811]].  In the attempt, discussion shifted from trying to patch the current implementation of ''parse_url()'' to replacing it with an re2c based parser.  The current implementation of ''parse_url()'' does not respect [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986|RFC 3986]] with regard to most of the components of a URL.  The bug in question noted that

<file php>
<?php
var_dump(parse_url("127.0.0.1:80", PHP_URL_HOST));

/* Outputs:
string(9) "127.0.0.1"
*/
</file>

While we all may agree that this is sensible, and totally expected, it is actually a lie.  That is not how the RFC defines how that string should be interpreted.  It should parse as a single PATH element ''string(12) "127.0.0.1:80"''.  Why?  Well the RFC defines the ''hier-part'', which contains the host portion, of the URI to be after a double-slash, to which the example lacks.  This would result in the ''path-noscheme'' portion of the parsing to match beginning at the ''1'' and fill the path until a ''?'' or ''#'' is found.

So a RFC standard implementation should be parsed as such:
<file php>
<?php
var_dump(parse_url("127.0.0.1:80", PHP_URL_HOST));
var_dump(parse_url("127.0.0.1:80", PHP_URL_PATH));

/* Outputs:
NULL
string(12) "127.0.0.1:80"
*/
</file>

The bug does state that the parsing difference between IPv4 address and IPv6 addresses are handled differently (in the sense that the IPv4 parsing isn't standards compliant).  However, according to the RFC, the simple case the user reported in the bug exists per the spec.

<file php>
<?php
var_dump(parse_url("127.0.0.1:80", PHP_URL_PATH));
var_dump(parse_url("[::1]:80", PHP_URL_PATH));

/* Outputs:
string(12) "127.0.0.1:80"
NULL
*/
</file>

This is due to the rules of the path, which allow a path to begin with a ''/'', or an alpha-numeric character.  Paths can not being with a ''['', and so the IPv6 formatted URI fails.  But with the above, we are basing what we expect to be the output based on a standards poor format.  A proper look at getting the correct HOST output for both an IPv4 and IPv6 example follows

<file php>
<?php
var_dump(parse_url("127.0.0.1:80/index.php", PHP_URL_HOST));
var_dump(parse_url("[::1]:80/index.php", PHP_URL_HOST));

var_dump(parse_url("//127.0.0.1:80/index.php", PHP_URL_HOST));
var_dump(parse_url("//[::1]:80/index.php", PHP_URL_HOST));

/* Outputs:
NULL
NULL
string(9) "127.0.0.1"
string(5) "[::1]"
*/
</file>

===== Proposal =====
The proposal of this RFC is two fold.  One, replace the current parser used for ''parse_url()'' to utilize re2c.  Two, ensure ''parse_url()'' more closely follows the RFC.  The function signature will not change, however, the return value will be more consistent.

The function can return
  * An array consisting of each component of the URI found.
  * A string|int of the component requested by the 2nd argument
  * NULL when we can not parse the URI, or, the component request contains no value

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Many of the tests that were developed for the current implementation of ''parse_url()'' have been changed to reflect a more standards compliant test.  This change will break anyone who is using the function with a non-standards compliant URI format.  This is the most problematic in terms of a BC break.  By this point, many people who use ''parse_url()'' might expect it to work in a, lets say, forgiving manner.  The example provided in the bug report is a perfect example of what I feel is a common use case of this function which will no longer act in a standards compliant method.
