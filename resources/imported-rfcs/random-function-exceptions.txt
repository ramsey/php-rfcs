====== PHP RFC: Core Functions Throwing Exceptions in PHP 7 ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2015-08-22
  * Author: Anthony Ferrara <ircmaxell@php.net>, Aaron Piotrowski <aaron@icicle.io>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/random-function-exceptions

===== Introduction =====
Concern has been raised over the way failure is indicated by several functions in the core that are often used for security purposes. These functions may fail open, allowing execution to continue, potentially compromising the security of an application. Failure of these functions is only indicating failure through a return value that may be inappropriate cast and used or requiring further function calls to check for failure. It is far too easy for an uninformed programmer to be unaware of the potential for failure and the consequences of neglecting to check for failure, so it is imperative that these functions fail closed, so execution cannot continue if the error is ignored.

The following functions are addressed by this RFC:

  * ''random_int()''
  * ''random_bytes()''

An example of a common use of these functions is:

<file php example.php>
<?php
$password = "";
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $password .= chr(random_int(33, 124));
}
?>
</file>

If ''random_int'' isn't able to capture enough entropy, it will error. In that case, ''$password'' would be 10 null bytes. Without careful error checking this could cause severe security issues. This is not acceptable and this RFC proposes to solve this by making all errors in these functions into exceptions.

===== Proposal =====
To fail closed while allowing the error to be handled, it is this RFCs proposal that the functions above throw exceptions upon failure. The specific types of exceptions and conditions from which they are thrown are outlined below.

=== random_int() ===
  * Throws ''TypeError'' if zend_parse_parameters fails.
  * Throws ''Exception'' if generating sufficiently random data fails.
  * Throws ''Error'' if ''$min > $max''.

=== random_bytes() ===
  * Throws ''TypeError'' if zend_parse_parameters fails.
  * Throws ''Exception'' if generating sufficiently random data fails.
  * Throws ''Error'' if ''%%$length <= 0%%''.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
''random_int()'' and ''random_bytes()'' are new functions to PHP 7, so changes to these functions do not have any backwards compatibility issues.

===== Proposed PHP Version =====
PHP 7.0.0

===== Future Scope =====

This RFC explicitly does not address how exceptions should be thrown from other core functions. This question will be addressed in a separate RFC. Focus was given to the particular functions in this RFC due to their importance to security applications.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
  * Throw exceptions

===== Patches and Tests =====
Below are implementations of ''random_int()'' and ''random_bytes()'' which throw exceptions, though not exactly what is outlined above. The pulls will be updated to throw the exceptions described above before merging.
