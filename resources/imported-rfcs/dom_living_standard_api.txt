===== Introduction =====

Working with XML (HTML) documents is a necessary task for many web applications
and the dom extension implements a standardized API that was previously
specified by a w3 group into 3 DOM Levels. Since then the standard has evolved
and is now a [[https://dom.spec.whatwg.org|Living Standard]] similar to HTML 5 and continuously evolving and
maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

Because the new API provides much improved traversal and manipulation APIs than the old API
we propose to add the new methods to the existing ext/dom API. Specifically we think this is a better solution to providing them in userland, because

  - ext/dom + DOMDocument are an implementation of the DOM Standard, so we should continue to support it with evolving versions.
  - the added methods are a huge value add for users/developers. Workarounds exist but are usually complex and hard to find for both newcomers and experienced developers that don't work with the dom extension everyday.

===== Proposal =====

====Implement new DOM Living Standard APIs for ext/dom====

This RFC proposes to adapt the current DOM standard changes to the PHP langauge by introducing new interfaces and public properties that simplify traversal and manipulation of DOM elements.

<code php>
<?php
interface DOMParentNode
{
    /** access to the first child of this node that is a DOMElement */
    public readonly DOMNode? $firstElementChild;
   
    /** access to the last child of this node that is a DOMElement */
    public readonly DOMNode? $lastElementChild;
    
    /** counts all child nodes that are DOMElements */
    public readonly int $childElementCount;

    /** appends one or many nodes to the list of children behind the last child node */
    public function append(...DOMNode|string|null $nodes) : void;
    
    /** prepends one or many nodes to the list of children before the first child node */
    public function prepend(...DOMNode|string|null $nodes) : void;
}

class DOMDocument implements DOMParentNode {}
class DOMElement implements DOMParentNode {}
class DOMDocumentFragment implements DOMParentNode {}

interface DOMChildNode
{
    /** Returns the previous node in the same hierachy that is a DOMElement or NULL if there is none */
    public readonly DOMNode? $previousElementSibling;
   
    /** Returns the next node in the same hierachy that is a DOMElement or NULL if there is none */ 
    public readonly DOMNode? $nextElementSibling;

    /** acts as a simpler version of $element->parentNode->removeChild($element); */
    public function remove() : void;
    
    /** add passed node(s) before the current node */
    public function before(...DOMNode|string|null $nodes) : void;
    
    /** add passed node(s) after the current node */
    public function after(...DOMNode|string|null $nodes) : void;
    
    /** replace current node with new node(s), a combination of remove() + append() */
    public function replaceWith(...DOMNode|string|null $nodes) : void;
}

class DOMElement implements DOMChildNode {}
class DOMCharacterData implements DOMChildNode {}
class DOMDocumentType implements DOMChildNode {}
</code>

====Implementation choices====

We deviate from the DOM Living Standard in some details, because it is written for Browser/Javascript implementations and the concepts cannot all be transferred 1:1 to PHP ext/dom.

The living standard implements //DOMParentNode// and //DOMChildNode// as "traits" or mixins and doesn't provide interfaces for them (as Javascript has no interfaces). This might make more sense with the primary language target (JavaScript), but for PHP it makes more sense to have the functionality available through an interface, so that code can test for //$node instanceof DOMParentNode// for example.

The living standard contains an intermediate trait (interface) //DOMNonDocumentTypeChildNode//
that defines the //previousElementSibling// and //nextElementSibling// properties.
This is introduced  in the living standard to provide backwards compatibility with browser/web
implementations, which are not our concern. In addition PHP interfaces cannot
declare properties, so it wouldn't make sense to add this empty interface. For this reason this interface //DOMNonDocumentTypeChildNode// will not be introduced and the properties are instead declared on each class implementing //DOMChildNode// directly.

The //querySelector// and //querySelectorAll// methods defined on the //DOMParentNode// interface are not implemented and the methods omitted fromt he interface, because of their underlying complexity (using a CSS query selector parser). We recommend to leave implementations of comparable functionality to userland libraries such as PhpCss or Symfony CSS Selector.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Code using registerNodeClass to overwrite DOM classes can be affected IF they already implement the new functionality in a way that doesn't satisfy the behavior or signature of this proposed code changes.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 8.0

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

No effect on SAPIs.

==== To Existing Extensions ====

The dom extensions API is changed in a mostly backwards compatible way (only adding new properties/methods). Breaking is code using registerNodeClass that adds child classes that also implement the new methods, but use a different signature.

The new functionality can all be implemented entirely using the already available libxml2 datastructures, so no changes to the libxml2 dependency is nceessary.

==== To Opcache ====

No effect on Opcache.
