====== PHP RFC: Null Propagation Operator ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2018-01-23
  * Author: Chris Wright, daverandom@php.net
  * Status: Draft

===== Proposal =====
A common requirement in object-oriented programming is the need to check whether an object is ''NULL'' before attempting access its members. At present in PHP this must be done by breaking the statement into multiple parts, typically assigning the result of an expression to a variable and then branching with an ''if'' statement. This RFC proposes an operator that would allow such checks to be written inline.

The following code sample demonstrates the pattern that must currently be used:

<code php>
class Foo
{
    private $bar;
  
    public function __construct(?Bar $bar)
    {
        $this->bar = $bar;
    }
    
    public function getBar(): ?Bar
    {
        return $this->bar;
    }
}
  
$foo = new Foo(null);

$bar = $foo->getBar();

// We must check that $bar is not null before attempting access its members
if ($bar !== null) {
    $result = $bar->method();
} else {
    $result = null;
}
</code>

This proposal would allow a question mark ''?'' to precede any object instance member access ''->''. This would cause the engine to check that the expression on the left of the member access does not evaluate to ''NULL'', if it does then no error will be emitted, the remainder of the expression on the right will be short-circuited and the expression will evaluate to ''NULL'':

<code php>
$result = $foo->getBar()?->method();
</code>
