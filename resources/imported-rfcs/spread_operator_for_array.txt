====== Spread Operator in Array Expression ======
  * Version: 0.2

===== Introduction =====
PHP has already supported [[rfc:argument_unpacking|argument unpacking]] (AKA spread operator) since 5.6. This RFC proposes to bring this feature to array expression.

===== Proposal =====
An array pair prefixed by ''...'' will be expanded in places during array definition. Only arrays and objects who implement Traversable can be expanded.

For example,
<code php>
$parts = ['apple', 'pear'];
$fruits = ['banana', 'orange', ...$parts, 'watermelon'];
// ['banana', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'watermelon'];
</code>

It's possible to do the expansion multiple times, and unlike argument unpacking, ''...'' can be used anywhere. It's possible to add normal elements before or after the spread operator.

Spread operator works for both array syntax(''array()'') and short syntax(''[]'').
<code php>
$arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
$arr2 = [...$arr1]; //[1, 2, 3]
$arr3 = [0, ...$arr1]; //[0, 1, 2, 3]
$arr4 = array(...$arr1, ...$arr2, 111); //[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 111]
</code>

==== String keys ====

In order to make the behavior consistent with [[rfc:argument_unpacking|argument unpacking]], string keys are not supported.

==== By-reference passing ====
It's not possible to unpack an array by reference.
<code php>
$arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
$arr2 = [...&$arr1]; //invalid
</code>

However, if elements in the array to be unpacked are stored by reference, they will be stored by reference in the new array as well.
<code php>
$one = 1;
$arr1 = [&$one, 2, 3];
$arr2 = [0, ...$arr1];
var_dump($arr2);
/*
array(4) {
  [0]=>
  int(0)
  [1]=>
  &int(1)
  [2]=>
  int(2)
  [3]=>
  int(3)
}
*/
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This change should not break anything.

===== Q & A =====
==== Advantages over array_merge ====
  - Spread operator should have a better performance than ''array_merge''. It's becuase not only that spread operator is a language structure while ''array_merge'' is a function call, but also compile time optimiztion can be performaned for constant arrays.
  - ''array_merge'' only supports array, while spread operator also supportes objects implementing ''Traversable''. 

==== ... should be preserved for other use (e.g. map concat) ====
This is kind of out of scope here to discuss other concat / merge operation. The important thing is we should make the behavior of same operator consistent and not to confuse userland developer. It's also why I changed the behavior for string keys in this revised version.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
next PHP 7.x, likely 7.4

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Opcache ====
I'm not sure if this RFC will have any impact on Opcache. I'll check it after I finish the patch.


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required. 

===== Patches and Tests =====

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
