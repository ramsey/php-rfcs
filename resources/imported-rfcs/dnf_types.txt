===== Introduction =====

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form|Disjunctive Normal Form]] (DNF) is a standard way of organizing boolean expressions.  Specifically, it means structuring a boolean expression into an ORed series of ANDs.  When applied to type declarations, it allows for a standard way to write combined Union and Intersection types that the parser can handle.

This RFC proposes to support DNF types in order to allow mixing of union and intersection types.

===== Proposal =====

==== Examples ====

For all examples that follow, assume the following definitions exist:

<code php>

interface A {}
interface B {}
interface C extends A {}
interface D {}

class W implements A {}
class X implements B {}
class Y implements A, B {}
class Z extends Y implements C {}
</code>


DNF types would allow type declarations for properties, parameters, and return values in the following form:

<code>
// Accepts an object that implements both A and B,
// OR an object that implements D.
(A&B)|D

// Accepts an object that implements C, 
// OR a child of X that also implements D,
// OR null.
C|(X&D)|null

// Accepts an object that implements all three of A, B, and D, 
// OR an int, 
// OR null.
(A&B&D)|int|null
</code>

The following examples are not in DNF form, and thus will generate a parse error.  However, they can be rewritten to DNF as shown.

<code>
A&(B|D)
// Can be rewritten as (A&B)|(A&D)

A|(B&(D|W)|null)
// Can be rewritten as A|(B&D)|(B&W)|null
</code>

The order of types within each AND/OR section is irrelevant, and thus the following type declarations are all equivalent:

<code>
(A&B)|(C&D|(Y&D)|null
(B&A)|null|(D&Y)|(C&D)
null|(C&D)|(B&A)|(Y&D)
</code>

Requiring DNF for all type declarations allows conceptually all potential combinations of intersection and union rules, but in a standard fashion that is easier for the engine and easier for humans and static analyzers to comprehend.  It also obviates the need for parentheses anywhere in the type definition.

==== Return co-variance ====

When extending a class, a method return type may narrow only.  That is, it must be the same or more restrictive as its parent.  In practice, that means additional ANDs may be added, but not additional ORs.

<code php>
interface ITest {
  public function stuff(): (A&B)|D;
}

// Acceptable.  A&B is more restrictive.
class TestOne implements ITest {
  public function stuff(): (A&B) {}
}

// Acceptable. D is is a subset of A&B|D
class TestTwo implements ITest {
  public function stuff(): D {}
}

// Acceptable, since C is a subset of A&B,
// even though it is not identical.
class TestThree implements ITest {
  public function stuff(): C|D {}
}

// Not acceptable. This would allow an object that
//  implements A but not B, which is wider than the interface.
class TestFour implements ITest {
  public function stuff(): A|D {}
}

interface ITestTwo {
  public function things(): C|D {}
}

// Not acceptable. Although C extends A and B, it's possible
// for an object to implement A and B without implementing C.
// Thus this definition is wider, and not allowed.
class TestFive implements ITestTwo {
  public function things(): (A&B)|D {}
}
</code>

==== Parameter contra-variance ====

When extending a class, a method parameter type may widen only.  That is, it must be the same or less restrictive as its parent.  In practice, that means additional ORs may be added, but not additional ANDs.

<code php>
interface ITest {
  public function stuff((A&B)|D $arg): void {}
}

// Acceptable. Everything that ITest accepts is still valid
// and then some.
class TestOne implements ITest {
  public function stuff((A&B)|D|Z $arg): void {}
}

// Acceptable. This accepts objects that implement just
// A, which is a super-set of those that implement A&B.
class TestOne implements ITest {
  public function stuff(A|D $arg): void {}
}

// Not acceptable. The interface says D is acceptable,
// but this class does not.
class TestOne implements ITest {
  public function stuff((A&B) $arg): void {}
}

interface ITestTwo {
  public function things(C|D $arg): void;
}

// Acceptable. Anything that implements C implements A&B,
// but this rule also allows classes that implement A&B
// directly, and thus is wider.
class TestFive implements ITestTwo {
  public function things((A&B)|D $arg): void;
}
</code>

==== Property invariance ====

Object properties are already invariant in inheritance. This RFC does not change that.  The type of a redeclared child property must logically match its parent.  However, the order of segments remains irrelevant.  The type declaration may be reordered provided that it is logically identical to its parent.

==== Reflection ====

This RFC does not introduce any new reflection classes.  However, it does make one change to the Reflection API, in that ''ReflectionUnionType::getTypes()'' previously was guaranteed to always return an array of ''ReflectionNamedType'' instances.  Now it will return some combination of ''ReflectionNamedType'' and ''ReflectionIntersectionType'' instances.  The method is already typed to return ''ReflectionType'' so this is not an API change, but the previous de facto assumption is no longer valid.

''ReflectionIntersectionType::getTypes()'' will still only return ''ReflectionNmaedType'' in practice, although its return type is similarly ''ReflectionType''.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

The sub-values of a ''ReflectionUnionType'' may now be ''ReflectionIntersectionType'' instances, rather than always being ''ReflectionNamedType''.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

===== Open Issues =====

Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====

==== Non-DNF types ====

In theory, supporting conjunctive normal form type definitions (and ANDed list of ORs) may be possible.  However, as DNF is able to represent all reasonable boolean expressions the authors have no intent to pursue this direction.

==== Type aliasing ====

DNF types have the potential to be rather verbose.  That puts additional pressure on the language to develop a type aliasing mechanism to allow for more convenient type names.  Such an RFC is best implemented as a separate follow up.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

This is a simple yes/no vote to include DNF types. 2/3 required to pass.
