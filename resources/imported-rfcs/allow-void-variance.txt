====== PHP RFC: Allow void return type variance ======

===== Rationale =====

This RFC proposes to change ''void'' 's behavior in class methods, because the current behavior resulted to cause more annoyance than benefit. What is proposed is backward compatible and in accordance with the goals of the previous ''void'' RFC.

The intent of ''void'' should be simply making clear to the reader that the function does not return anything useful, and that any attempt to use the returned value should be considered an invalid operation.

It shouldn't do more than that, but currently it also denies methods to be overridden with different types in subclasses. 

<code php>
class Foo{
    function method (): void  {}
}

class Bar extends Foo{
    function method (): array { return []; } // fails
}

class Baz extends Foo{
    function method ()        { return 42; } // also fails
}
</code>

This should be allowed because it is causing discontent among users, and, most importantly, because it achieves nothing at all apart getting in the way of the developers.

<code php>
function myFooConsumer (Foo $foo) {

   // method() is void, therefore we won't be using its return type
   
   $foo->method();
}
</code>

If a ''Bar'' object is passed to the function (i.e. ''myFooConsumer(new Bar())''), even if ''Bar::method()'' now returns an ''array'',
it is not breaking the code in ''myFooConsumer'', because the function ''myFooConsumer'' has no interest in the return value of
''method()'' at all.

Even if it's receiving a ''Bar'' object, the function was originally written to be compatible with ''Foo'' objects.
The ''method()'' can return anything, or nothing at all, but ''myFooConsumer'' just does not care about it.

For this reason adding a type to ''void'' in subclasses is not an invalid operation, and denying it is a pointless restriction. Changing from ''void'' to something else is very probably a bad idea, but PHP should not enforce ''void'' in subclasses just on that basis.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to allow ''void'' to be changed to any type (including ''mixed'') in sub classes.
The rest of the current behavior of ''void'' is preserved.

A ''void'' return's inheritance would work exactly like ''mixed''; that is, the following methods follow the very same covariance rules:

<code php>
class Foo{
    function method1 (): void  {}
    function method2 ()        {}
}

class Bar extends Foo{
    function method1 (): array { return []; }
    function method2 (): array { return []; }
}

class Baz extends Foo{
    function method1 ()        { return 42; }
    function method2 ()        { return 42; }
}
</code>

Except that ''method1'', unlike ''method2'', makes clear that it's not returning anything (but it might do so in subclasses).

''void'' can be overridden to any type including ''mixed'' and ''void'' itself, but ''mixed'' can't be overridden with ''void'' like so:

<code php>
class Foo{
    function method (): void {}
}

class Bar extends Foo{
    function method ()       {} // ok
}

class Baz extends Bar{
    function method (): void {} // error: can't go back to void
}
</code>

This is technically not invalid since ''mixed'' includes ''null'', but it certainly feels "not LSP-valid" and it's therefore disallowed by this RFC.

And, more obviously, also the following is disallowed:

<code php>
class Foo{
    function method (): void   {}
}

class Bar extends Foo{
    function method (): string {} // ok
}

class Baz extends Bar{
    function method (): void   {} // error: can't go back to void
}
</code>
