===== Introduction =====
''uniqid()'', against all expectations from the name, doesn't produce unique IDs. While there is a ''sleep()'' to prevent multiple duplicate IDs in the same process, there's no such guarantee and even a rather high probability of duplicate IDs with more processes or even multiple servers. This is due to ''uniqid()'' being time based and adding only insufficient random.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes to emit deprecation warnings for any usage of ''uniqid()''. Current usages should be replaced with either  ''random_bytes()'' (maybe in combination with ''bin2hex()'' or any other encoding of their choice) or an UUID implementation of the developer's choice.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
All BC breaks are intentional and outlined in the RFC.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Deprecation notice in PHP 7.3 and removal in PHP 8.0.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Simple yes / no vote with 2/3 majority.

===== Patches and Tests =====
TBD.
