====== PHP RFC: Scalar Pseudo-type ======

===== Introduction =====
Some procedures are capable of accepting or returning any type of the ones that are considered [[https://php.net/is-scalar|scalar]]. PHP does not have support for union types and the only way to communicate such support to callers or receivers is via documentation. This RFC proposes the addition of a special ''scalar'' pseudo-type that covers all types that are considered ''scalar'' – namely ''bool'', ''float'', ''int'', and ''string'' – to be valid for both parameter and return type constraints.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes a new ''scalar'' pseudo-type. This type is analogous to ''callable'' and ''iterable'', accepting multiple types instead of one single type.

''scalar'' accepts ''bool'', ''float'', ''int'', and ''string''. All of these types can be safely coerced to a ''string'' and be printed.

''scalar'' can be used as a parameter type constraint to require that a procedure is called with any of the types that are considered scalar.

<code php>
function f(scalar $param) {
    echo "{$param}\n";
}
</code>

''scalar'' can be combined with the nullable constraint to broaden the amount of types that are accepted.

<code php>
function f(?scalar $param) {
    echo "{$param}\n";
}
</code>

''scalar'' can also be used as a return type constraint to indicate that a procedure will return any of ''bool'', ''float'', ''int'', or ''string''. The combination with the nullable constraint is supported here as well.

<code php>
function f(): scalar {
    return 42;
}

function f(): ?scalar {
    return null;
}
</code>

Parameters that are constrained to ''scalar'' may use a ''bool'', ''float'', ''int'', ''null'', or ''string'' as default value.

<code php>
function f0(scalar $p = null)  {}
function f1(scalar $p = true)  {}
function f2(scalar $p = 4.2)   {}
function f3(scalar $p = 42)    {}
function f4(scalar $p = 'str') {}
</code>

Classes extending or implementing a supertype that has a ''scalar'' compatible parameter type constraint may broaden that constraint to be ''scalar'' (contravariance).

<code php>
interface A {
    function f1(bool   $p);
    function f2(float  $p);
    function f3(int    $p);
    function f4(string $p);
}

interface B implements A {
    function f1(scalar $p);
    function f2(scalar $p);
    function f3(scalar $p);
    function f4(scalar $p);
}
</code>

Classes extending or implementing a supertype that has a ''scalar'' return type constraint may narrow that constraint down to a compatible type (covariance).

<code php>
interface A           { function f(): scalar; }
interface B extends A { function f(): bool;   }
interface C extends A { function f(): float;  }
interface D extends A { function f(): int;    }
interface E extends A { function f(): string; }
</code>

The function [[https://php.net/is-scalar|is_scalar]] to determine whether a value is ''scalar'' or not already exist in PHP since a long time and must not be added.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
''scalar'' is implemented as reserved name, therefore a class, interface, or trait named ''scalar'' cannot be declared. 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
7.3.0

===== Future Scope =====
  * Addition of an interface that allows objects to be considered ''scalar''.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This proposal requires a 2/3 majority to be accepted. 

===== Patches and Tests =====
  * [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2987|GitHub PR #2987]]
