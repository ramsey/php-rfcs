  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/same-site-cookie

===== Introduction =====
Same-site cookies allow servers to mitigate the risk of CSRF and information leakage attacks by asserting that a particular cookie should only be sent with requests initiated from the same registrable domain. The technology is currently [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07|a proposed web standard]]. However, same site cookies are already  adopted by Chrome and planned by [[https://caniuse.com/#search=samesite|planned by Firefox]]. Major PHP frameworks already implemented this through a custom Set-Cookie header call. The RFC will try to convince voters that same site cookies should be implemented as a core language feature.

===== Proposal =====

The proposal affects four functions in the PHP API.

  - setcookie
  - setrawcookie
  - session_set_cookie_params
  - session_get_cookie_params

==== setrawcookie ====
