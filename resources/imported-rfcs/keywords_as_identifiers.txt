====== PHP RFC: Extended keyword support ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2013-09-14
  * Author: Bob Weinand, bobwei9@hotmail.com
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/keywords_as_identifiers

===== Introduction =====

This RFC aims to remove some restrictions which are due to the fact that keywords are not included in T_STRING.

===== Proposal =====

Concretely this patch enables:
  * all keywords for
    * method names
    * class constant names
    * declare directive names
  * a limited set of keywords ***** for
    * class names
    * trait names
    * interface names
    * goto label names

***** This includes all keywords except
  * catch
  * finally
  * case
  * default
  * exit
  * else
  * elseif
  * endif
  * endwhile
  * endfor
  * endforeach
  * enddeclare
  * endswitch
It is necessary to exclude them due to limitations of bison/yacc grammar.

<code php>
namespace Test {
    class List {
        const default = 0;
        public $case = array(array(self::default));
 
        public static function echo (List $instance) {
            var_dump($instance->case);
        }
 
        public function new (array $entry) {
            $this->case[] = $entry;
            return $this;
        }
    }
}
 
namespace {
    \Test\List::echo((new Test\List)->new(array(1)));
}
