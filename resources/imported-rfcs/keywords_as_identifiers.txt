====== PHP RFC: Extended keyword support ======
  * Version: 1.2
  * Date: 2013-09-14
  * Author: Bob Weinand, bobwei9@hotmail.com
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/keywords_as_identifiers

===== Introduction =====

This RFC aims to remove some restrictions which are due to the fact that keywords are not included in T_STRING (especially for class const, method and class names).

===== What is now possible =====

  * One might want to define an HTTP agent class. And would like to store some HTTP status constants:
<code php>
class HTTP {
    const CONTINUE = 100; // Works with patch
// But currently this fails with a parse error, because continue is a keyword.
    const SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS = 101;
    // etc. ...
}
</code>
  * Building conditions with "and" or "or" methods
<code php>
class Cond {
    public static function and (...) { // using an "and" or "or" as name currently fails
        // some logic here
        return $andCondition;
    }

    public static function or (...) {
        // some logic here
        return $orCondition;
    }
}

Cond::and($cond1, $cond2);
</code>
  * Prevents unnecessary use of _****_call magic method ("-****>keyword_name_for_non_static_method()" works, but "public function keyword_name_for_non_static_method() {}" currently fails)
<code php>
// Ugly, current code
class SomeClass {
    private $list = [];

    public function _list () {
        return $this->list;
    }

    public function __call ($func, $args) {
        if (method_exists($this, "_".$func)) {
            return call_user_func_array("_".$func, $args); // or some similar thing, if not underscores etc....
        }
        // some error handling here
    }
}

// How we could write it with the patch
class SomeClass {
    private $list = [];

    public function list () {
        return $this->list;
    }
}
</code>

===== Details of proposal =====

Concretely this patch enables:
  * all keywords for
    * method names
    * class constant names
    * declare directive names
    * class names
    * trait names
    * interface names
    * goto label names
    * namespace names
  * actual language features are preserved:
    * a label (for goto) named //default// or //else// won't work ("default:" in switch or "else:" in alternative if structure)
    * a namespace named //namespace// won't work (a namespace name beginning with "namespace\" is a relative namespace name)
    * a class constant named //class// can't be defined ("classname::class" has a special meaning)
    * ...

An example what is possible with this patch:
<code php>
namespace Test {
    class List {
        const default = 0;
        public $case = array(array(self::default));
 
        public static function echo (List $instance) {
            var_dump($instance->case);
        }
 
        public function new (array $entry) {
            $this->case[] = $entry;
            return $this;
        }
    }
}
 
namespace {
    \Test\List::echo((new Test\List)->new(array(1)));
}
</code>

==== Typehints ====

Currently when using array or callable as typehint, the old behaviour is preferred over comparing if it's a class/interface named array or callable.
I'm not sure if we should just allow both in this special case.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This RFC should go into next PHP 5.x.

===== Patch =====

  * The patch is against master
  * Pull request is at [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/438]]

===== References =====

  * Mailing List thread at [[http://markmail.org/message/7rn4mbwkbytqa3ig]]

===== Rejected Features =====

  * Initially the patch contained also some support for functions and constants which was removed later due to some resulting syntactic inconsistencies

===== Versions =====
  * 1.0: Initial proposal (16.9.2013)
  * 1.1: Added some more examples (18.9.2013)
  * 1.2: Removed some restrictions (now all keywords are permitted except the ones which would conflict with the existing language) (16.10.2013)
