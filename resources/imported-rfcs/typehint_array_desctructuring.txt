====== PHP RFC: Type hints in array destructuring expressions ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2020-04-16
  * Target Version: PHP 8.0
  * Author: Enno Woortmann, enno.woortmann@web.de
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
Adds the possibility to type hint values while using array or list destructuring expressions.

===== Motivation =====

When working with array destructuring expressions it's currently not possible to type hint the values from the array being destructured. As the destructured data often comes from various sources which may or may not be controlled by the scope executing the destructuring, a type hint inside the expression allows stricter boundaries for the processed array:

<code php>
$data = [42, 'Example', 2002];
[int $id, string $data, int $year] = $data;
</code>

===== Proposal =====
This proposal adds a new syntax to add type hints to array destructuring expressions. The type hints behave identically to the type hints processed for function calls (compare https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5). This includes a controllability of the behaviour using the strict_types directive:

<code php>
declare(strict_types=0);

// as we have disabled strict_types this is ok
[int $now, int $future] = ["2020", "2021"];
</code>

<code php>
declare(strict_types=1);

// as we have enabled strict_types this will lead to an error
[int $now, int $future] = [2020, "2021"];
// Catchable fatal error: element 2 of array destructuring expression must be of type integer, string given
</code>

<code php>
// type hinting an assiciative array destructuring
["now" => int $now, "future" => int $future] = ["now" => 2020, "future" => 2021];

// type hinting a nested array destructuring
[
    "2020s" => [
        "now" => int $now,
        "future" => int $future,
    ]
] = [
    "2020s" => [
        "now" => 2020,
        "future" => 2021,
    ],
    "2030s" => [
        "far away" => 2039,
    ],
];

// type hinting in a foreach loop
$years = [["now", 2020], ["future", 2021]];
foreach ($years as [string $description, int $year]) {
    // ...
}
</code>

Additionally to the examples above which all use scalar type hints also object type hints are possible:

<code php>
foreach ($objectList as [DateTime $creationTime, MyObject $object]) {
    // ...
}
</code>

All of the examples above also work with the list() syntax.
