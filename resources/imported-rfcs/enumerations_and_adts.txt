===== Introduction =====

This RFC introduces Enumerations to PHP.  Specifically, it introduces what are variously called "Algebraic Data Types", "tagged unions", or simply "enumerations" depending on the language.  This capability offers greatly expanded support for data modeling, custom type definitions, and monad-style behavior.  Enums enable the modeling technique of "make invalid states unrepresentable", which leads to more robust code with less need for exhaustive testing.

Many languages have support for enumerations of some variety.  A [[https://github.com/Crell/enum-comparison|survey we conducted of various languages]] found that they could be categorized into three general groups: Fancy Constants, Fancy Objects, and full Algebraic Data Types.  For this implementation we opted to implement full Algebraic Data Types, as that offers the most robust set of functionality while also degrading gracefully to simpler use cases.  (Or it progressively enhances to more complex use cases, depending on your point of view.)

The specific implementation here draws inspiration primarily from Swift, Rust, and Kotlin, but is not (nor is it intended as) a perfect 1:1 port of any of them.

The most popular case of enumerations is ''%%boolean%%'', which is an enumerated type with legal values ''%%true%%'' and ''%%false%%''.  This RFC allows developers to define their own arbitrarily robust enumerations.

===== Proposal =====

==== Basic enumerations ====

This RFC introduces a new language construct, ''%%enum%%''.  Enums are similar to classes, and share the same namespaces as classes, interfaces, and traits.  They are also autoloadable the same way.  An Enum defines a new type, which has a fixed, limited number of possible legal values.

<code php>
enum Suit {
  case Hearts;
  case Diamonds;
  case Clubs;
  case Spades;
}
</code>

This declaration creates a new enumerated type named %%Suit%%, which has four and only four legal values: ''%%Suit::Hearts%%'', ''%%Suit::Diamonds%%'', ''%%Suit::Clubs%%'', and ''%%Suit::Spades%%''.  Variables may be assigned to one of those legal values.  A function may be type checked against an enumerated type, in which case only values of that type may be passed.

<code php>
$val = Suit::Diamonds;

function pick_a_card(Suit $suit) { ... }

pick_a_card($val);       // OK
pick_a_card(Suit:Clubs); // OK
pick_a_card('Spades');   // throws TypeError
</code>

In the simple case, multiple cases may be defined on a single line.  The following is semantically equivalent to the definition above.

<code php>
enum Suit {
  case Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades;
}
</code>

An Enumeration may have one or more ''%%case%%'' definitions, with no maximum, although at least one is required.

Cases are not backed by a primitive value.  That is, ''%%Suit::Hearts%%'' is not equal to 0.  Instead, each case is backed by a singleton object of that name.  That means that:

<code php>
$a = Suit::Spades;
$b = Suit::Spades;

$a === $b; // true
</code>


Each Case class includes a default ''%%__toString()%%'' implementation that returns the name of the Case as a string, without the Enum type.  That is:

<code php>
print Suit::Clubs; 
// prints "Clubs", not "Suit::Clubs".
</code>

That function may be overridden if desired.  (See below.)

[To Ilija: Do we want this part or not?  I only thought of it while writing this.  I don't know if it's good or bad.]

Enumerated type Cases may be used in union type definitions.  For example:

<code php>
function gimmie_red_card(Suit::Hearts|Suit::Diamonds $card) { ... }
</code>

==== Enumerated Case Methods ====

As both Enum Types and Enum Cases are implemented using classes, they may take methods.  The Enum Type may also implement an interface, which all Cases must then fulfill, directly or indirectly.

<code php>

interface Colorful {
  public function color(): string;
}

enum Suit implements Colorful {
  case Hearts {
    public function color(): string {
      return "Red";
    }
  };  // Note the semi-colon here!
  
  case Diamonds {
    public function color(): string {
      return "Red";
    }
  };
  
  case Clubs {
    public function color(): string {
      return "Black";
    }
  };
  
  case Spades {
    public function color(): string {
      return "Black";
    }
  };
  
  public function shape(): string {
    return "Rectangle";
  }
}
</code>

In this example, all four Enum cases will have a method ''%%shape%%'' inherited from ''%%Suit%%'', and will all have their own method ''%%color%%'', which they implement themselves.  Case methods may be arbitrarily complex, and function the same as any other method.  Additionally, magic methods such as ''%%__toString%%'' and friends may also be implemented and will behave like a normal method on an object.  The one exception is ''%%__construct%%'', which it not permitted.  (See below.)

Static methods on Cases are not supported.

Inside a method on a Case, The ''%%$this%%'' variable is defined and refers to the Case instance.  (That is mainly useful with Associated Values.  See below.)

(Note that in this case it would be a better data modeling practice to also define a ''%%SuitColor%%'' Enum Type with values Red and Black and return that instead.  However, that would complicate this example.)

The above hierarchy is logically similar to the following class structure:

<code php>

interface Colorful {
  public function color(): string;
}

abstract class Suit implements Colorful {
  public function shape(): string {
    return "Rectangle";
  }
}

class Hearts extends Suit {
  public function color(): string {
    return "Red";
  }
}

class Diamonds extends Suit {
  public function color(): string {
    return "Red";
  }
}

class Clubs extends Suit {
  public function color(): string {
    return "Black";
  }
}
  
class Spades extends Suit {
  public function color(): string {
    return "Black";
  }
}
</code>

==== Associated Values ====

Enumerated Cases may optionally include associated values.  An associated value is one that is associated with an instance of a Case.  If a Case has associated values, it will //**not**// be implemented as a singleton.  Each instance of the Case will then be its own object instance, so will not === another instance.

Bound values are defined using constructor property promotion.

<code php>
enum Distance {
    case Kilometers(public int $num);
    case Miles(public int $num);
}

$my_walk = Distance::Miles(500);
// Named parameters work like any other function call.
$next_walk = Distance::Miles(num: 500);

print $my_walk->num; // prints "500"

$my_walk === $next_walk; // FALSE!
</code>

Enum Cases may not implement a full constructor.  However, they may list parameters that will be auto-promoted to properties using constructor promotion.  The visibility modifier is required.  Cases may not implement properties other than promoted properties.

An Enum Case that supports Associated Values is called an Associable Case.  An Enum Case that does not have Associated Values is called a Unit Case.  An Enumerated Type may consist of any combination of Associable and Unit Cases.

Associated values are always read-only, both internally to the class and externally.  Therefore, making them public does not pose a risk of 3rd party code modifying them inadvertently.  They may, however, have attributes associated with them like any other property.

Use cases that would require more complete class functionality (arbitrary properties, custom constructors, mutable properties, etc.) should be implemented using traditional classes instead.

==== Examples ====

Below are a few examples of Enums in action.

=== Maybe ===

The (in)famous Maybe Monad can be implemented like this:

<code php>
enum Maybe {
  // This is a Unit Case.
  case None {
    public function bind(callable $f) {
      return $this;
    }
  };
    
  // This is an Associable Case.
  case Some {
  // Note that the return type can be the Enum itself, thus restricting the return
  // value to one of the enumerated types.    case Some(public $val): Maybe {
    public function bind(callable $f) {
      // $f is supposed to return a Maybe itself.
      return $f($this->value);
    }
  };

  // This method is available on both None and Some.
  public function value(): mixed {
    // Still need to sort out match() for this to make sense.
    return match ($this) {
        Optional::None => throw new Exception(),
        Optional::Some => $this->val,
    };
  }
}
</code>

=== Single unit enums ===

Because all properties on an Enum are readonly, they offer a back-door way to create immutable objects.

<code php>
enum Point {
  case ThreeD(public $x, public $x, public $z);
}

$p = Point::ThreeD(x: 3, y: 5, z: 7);

print $p->y; // prints 5
$p->z = 9;   // throws an Error of some kind, TBD.
</code>

This is not a specific design goal of the implementation, but a potentially useful side effect.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

"enum" becomes a language keyword, with the usual potential for naming conflicts with existing global constants.
