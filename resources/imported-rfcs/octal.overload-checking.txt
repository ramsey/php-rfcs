===== Introduction =====
Parsing of Octal (base 8) numbers contained in an interpolated string currently matches the pattern \\[0-7]{1,3}, that is a backslash followed by between one and three octits (numbers with an ordinal value between zero and seven).  However, in order for a 3 octit number to fit within the space of a single character (one byte), the first octit is actually limited to base 4 (values from 0 to 3).

Currently, PHP does not guard against an overflow in the first octit of a 3 octit octal value, instead allowing the value to silently overflow without warning.  Thus "\000" === "\400", "\100" === "\500", "\200" === "\600", and "\300" === "\700", and so on...

===== Proposal =====
This RFC seeks to decide which approach to take in addressing this undesired behavior.

  - Do nothing.  Some terrible application is relying on this behavior and there's no burning need to fix it.
  - Retain the current overflow behavior, but raise a compile-time warning "Octal escape sequence overflow {} is greater than \\377"
  - Limit octal numbers to \\[0-3]?[0-7]{0,2} meaning that sequences like "\456" would be parsed as octal 45 (decimal 37, e.g. a '%' character) followed by a literal 6

Options 2 and 3 may involve a deprecation/warning period followed by a permanent change.

**Update:** Between minimal comment and a lack of severity of this case.  I've opted to initiate a vote for option 2.  Produce a compile-time warning about value overflow.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

New compile-time warning is raised on overflow during interpolation.
