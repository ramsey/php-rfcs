====== PHP RFC: Typed class constants ======
  * Date: 2020-07-06
  * Author: Benas Seliuginas <benas.molis.iml@gmail.com>
  * Target version: PHP 8.1
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
TODO

===== Proposal =====
Under this RFC, code like:

<code php>
class Table {
	protected const TABLE_NAME = null;

	...

	public function delete(): void {
		if (!is_string(static::TABLE_NAME) || !is_null(static::TABLE_NAME)) {
			throw new Exception('Type of TABLE_NAME must be string|null');
		}

		$this->database->delete(static::TABLE_NAME);
	}
}
</code>

...might be written as:

<code php>
class Table {
	protected const string|null TABLE_NAME = null;

	...

	public function delete(): void {
		$this->database->delete(static::TABLE_NAME);
	}
}
</code>

...without sacrificing any type-safety.

==== Supported types ====
Class constant type declarations support all type declarations supported by PHP, with the exception of ''void'', ''callable'', ''object'' and class names.

Class names (including ''self'', ''static'' and ''parent'') are not supported because it is not useful and would be performance expensive. For PHP, all objects are mutable. Since constants should never change at runtime but objects can, class name types are not supported. Thus, the ''object'' type is also not allowed given that it's a union type of all classes and interfaces.

Meanwhile, ''void'' and ''callable'' types are not supported due to the same issues as discussed in the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/typed_properties_v2#supported_types|typed properties v2 RFC]].

==== Strict and coercive typing modes ====
The ''strict_types'' mode has no impact on behavior since class constants are immutable and thus, the type check will be performed anyways. This is consistent with the handling of typed properties' default values.

==== Inheritance and variance ====
Class constants are covariant. This means that the type of a class constant is not allowed to be widen during inheritance. If the parent class constant is private, then the type may change arbitrarily.

<code php>
class Test {
	private const int A = 1;
	public const mixed B = 1;
	public const int C = 1;
}

class Test2 extends Test {
	// this is legal (because Test::A is private)
	public const string A = 'a';

	// this is legal
	public const int B = 0;

	// this is illegal
	public const mixed C = 0;
}
</code>

The reason why class constant types are covariant is that they are read only i. e. declared once. The change from ''int'' to ''mixed'' implies that reads from the class constant may now return values of any type in addition to integers.

==== Constant values ====
Constant values have to match the type of the class constant. The only exception is that float class constants also accept integer constant values, consistent with the handling for parameter/property types.

The following code illustrates legal and illegal default values:
<code php>
class Test {
	// this is legal
	public const string A = 'a';
	public const int B = 1;
	public const float C = 1.1;
	public const bool D = true;
	public const array E = ['a', 'b'];

	// this is legal
	public const iterable F = ['a', 'b'];
	public const mixed G = 1;
	public const string|array H = 'a';
	public const int|null I = null;

	// this is legal (special exemption)
	public const float J = 1;

	// this is illegal
	public const string K = 1;
	public const int L = null;
}
</code>

If the constant value is a non compile-time evaluable initializer expression, the constant value is not checked at compile-time. Instead it will be checked during constant-updating, which will either occur when an object of the class is instantiated or when the class constant is being fetched. As such, the following code is legal:

<code php>
class Test {
	public const int TEST = TEST;
}

define('TEST', 1);

// this prints 1
echo Test::TEST;
</code>

If the constant held an illegal type, a ''TypeError'' exception would be generated during the object ''new Test()'' instantiation or when the class constant ''Test::TEST'' is being fetched.

==== Reflection ====
The ''ReflectionClassConstant'' class is extended by two methods:
<code php>
class ReflectionClassConstant implements Reflector {
	...

	public function getType(): ?ReflectionType {}
	public function hasType(): bool {}
}
</code>
''getType()'' returns a ''ReflectionType'' if the class constant has a type, and null otherwise.
''hasType()'' returns ''true'' if the class constant has a type, and false otherwise. The behavior matches that of ''getType()''/''hasType()'' for parameters/properties and ''getReturnType()''/''hasReturnType()'' for return types.

===== Backwards incompatible changes =====
None.

===== Impact on extensions =====
None.

To preserve backwards compatibility with extensions, a new function ''zend_declare_typed_class_constant()'' is introduced while keeping the original ''zend_declare_class_constant_ex()'' function intact.

===== Vote =====
2/3 majority Yes/No.
