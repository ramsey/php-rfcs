====== Zend Engine Performance Improvements ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2010-04-13
  * Author: Dmitry Stogov <dmitry@zend.com>, Stanislav Malyshev <stas@zend.com>
  * Status: Implemented in 5.4
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/performanceimprovements

This RFC offers several Zend Engine changes which together make up to 20% performance improvement on synthetic benchmarks and some real-life applications. 

===== Empty HashTable Optimization =====

During execution PHP uses a lot of HashTables, and our research showed that a significant part of these tables still empty throughout their entire lifetime. For example each PHP class has fully-allocated & initialized method/constant/properties tables even if it doesn't have method/constants/properties. Note that during HashTable initialization it allocates space for pointers to Buckets (HashTable->arBuckets[]). Of course, this allocation takes space and time.

The idea for improvement is to delay the actual allocation of HashTable->arBuckets[] in the various tables until the insertion of first element. As a result PHP will use a bit less memory and save one [e]malloc()/[e]free() for each empty HashTable. On the other hand it'll have to check if the HashTable was initialized on each new element insertion.

The patch improves speed of bench.php from **4.31** sec to **4.06** sec and micro_bench.php from **19.78** sec to **19.36** sec.
 
===== Literal Tables =====

Currently ZE uses a virtual machine with fixed 3-operand opcode representation. Each operand is represented as a union which may hold a zval (literal - a constant value known at compile time). So for each opcode we have to allocate space for 3 zvals even if the opcode doesn't use them. Each opcode requires 76 bytes on a 32-bit system.

The proposed patch moves zvals from the opcodes themselves into a separate literal_table. Each op_array will have its own literal_table and its opcodes will contain pointers into this table. In addition the opcode structure was changed a bit to remove znode.u.EA.type and align data in a better way. As result each opcode will take only 28 bytes on 32-bit system. 

For string constants the literal_table also contains a pre-calculated hash_value, which can be used during run-time. Some ZE internal functions were extended to receive and use additional zend_literal argument in case of constant operands. Several opcodes which use case-insensitive string operands (e.g. function and class references) allocate two following entries in the literal_table. The opcode itself points to the first entry which contains the original string value and the next entry contains the same lower-cased string. This allows performing most ZE primitive operations (e.g. function call, class fetch, method call, property access, etc) with constant operands without hash_value recalculation and lower-casing.

The patch improves speed of bench.php to **4.01** sec and micro_bench.php to **17.95** sec.
It also significantly reduces the memory usage of real-life applications with big code base. For example it reduce resident memory usage of PHP process which loads all Zend Framework classes from 27M to 22M (saves 5M or 18% per process).

//Note: In the future this patch may be extended with moving zend_op.lineno into a separate debug_info data structure.//

===== Interned Strings =====

Interned strings is a well known technique originally implemented in functional languages. Its main idea is that each string (or atom) is allocated once and never changed (immutable). (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning for more details). Our implementation makes the strings which are known at compile-time interned. The attempt to make all the strings interned made a significant slowdown on some applications that perform a lot of dynamic string operations. The patch introduces IS_INTERNED() macro to check if a given char* is interned or regular string. PHP doesn't have to duplicate or destroy interned strings in zval_copy_ctor() and zval_dtor(), but it must also not modify them in place. Interned strings contain pre-calculated hash_values so some opcodes with variable arguments won't require hash_value recalculation any more. For example:

<code php>
$a = "hello";
$arr[$a] = "world"; // hash_value is pre-calculated at compile-time
</code>

In addition interned strings may be compared just using == C operator instead of strcmp(). It makes additional benefit at PHP string comparison and HashTable manipulation.

The patch uses a fixed preallocated memory region to hold all the interned strings. IS_INTERNED() is represented simple as a region boundary checks. In case the region is exceeded all the strings which would going to be interned are still regular char*. To create interned strings the CG(new_interned_string)() callback should be used. Interned strings allocated during request processing are held in memory until the end of request processing. It's done through CG(interned_strings_snapshot)() and CG(interned_strings_restore)(). //Opcode caches have to dynamically override these callbacks to hold interned strings in shared memory.// 

The patch improves speed of bench.php to **3.60** sec and micro_bench.php to **14.97** sec.

//Note: The usage of special data structure (e.g. zend_string) instead of char* throughout PHP  would probably be a more consistent solution, but it would be a huge break. We are going to look into this solution in the future.//

===== Zend Engine VM Tuning =====

Mainly involves manual tuning based on profile feedback and CPU performance counters. The patch eliminates redundant instructions, performs additional source-level specialization, allows C compiler to make better register allocation and registers spilling. In general it doesn't change behavior or binary-compatibility except for 3 things:

  - ZEND_RECV result value is always IS_CV (previously it could be IS_VAR for arguments named $this or $_GET)
  - ZEND_CATCH has to be used with constant class name (previously it could be used with "self", "parent", "static")
  - ZEND_FETCH_DIM_? opcode handlers may perform array and index fetching in different way. As result if both of them are undefined the warning messages may be emitted in a different order.

The patch improves speed of bench.php to **3.49** sec and micro_bench.php to **14.63** sec

===== Performance Evaluation =====

The previous numbers were got without any opcode caches and optimizers.
