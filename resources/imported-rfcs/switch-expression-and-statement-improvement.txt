====== PHP RFC: Switch Expression & Switch Statement Improvement ======
  * Version: 1.0

  * Author: Michał Brzuchalski <brzuchal@php.net>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

The current design of PHP's switch statement follows closely languages such as C/C++ and supports fall-through semantics by default.
The traditional switch statement is unnecessarily verbose which often leads to missing break statements mean that accidentally fall-through occurs.
The idea of this RFC is to extend switch statement so it can be used as either a statement or an expression which can use simplified control flow behaviour and scoping similar to arrow functions.

===== Proposal =====
The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a simplified control flow and direct return value
allowed to be used as an expression.

Following example shows how a switch statement can be unnecessarily verbose and how visual noise could 
lead to accidental fall-through occurs.

<code php>
<?php

switch (date("w")) {
  case 0:
    $say = "weekend!";
    break;
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
  case 4:
  case 5:
    $say = "weekday :(";
    break;
  case 6:
    $say = "weekend!"
}
echo "Today is {$say}";
</code>

==== Switch Statement Improvement ====

The proposal is to reduce noise added by repeating separate case labels by grouping them in the comma-separated list.

Above example show how to group set of labels which takes the same expression block as an action in response to any label statement match.

<code php>
<?php

switch (date("w")) {
  case 0:
    $say = "weekend!";
    break;
  case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:
    $say = "weekday :(";
    break;
  case 6:
    $say = "weekend!";
}
echo "Today is {$say}";
</code>

==== Switch Expression Introduction ====

The proposal is to introduce a new form of switch label, written "case C =>" to signify that only 
the code to the right of the label is to be executed if the label is matched and in consequence 
value of that code should be the return value of switch expression.

Following example demonstrates noise and verbosity reduce.

<code php>
<?php

$say = switch (date("w")) {
  case 0 => "weekend!";
  case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 => "weekday :(";
  case 6 => "weekend!";
};
echo "Today is {$say}";
</code>

> **Note!** Switch expression allows evaluating single expression just like the arrow function. This restriction can be relaxed in the future.

==== Return type ====

The nature of switch expression which returns matched expression block allows specifying an optional return 
type-hint to enforce result type restriction.

<code php>
<?php

$say = switch (date("w")): string {
  case 0 => "weekend!";
  case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 => "weekday :(";
  case 6 => true; // This throws TypeError when resulting expression evaluates with different type
};
echo "Today is {$say}";
</code>

==== Non-completeness ====

The nature of switch statement returning always a value which must match optional type-hint if given
results in RuntimeException if none of the labels evaluated on a match.

<code php>
<?php

$kind = "baz";
$foo = switch ($kind): string {
  case "foo" => "matched 'foo'!";
  case "bar" => "matched 'bar'";
}; // This trows RuntimeException cause there is no default clause and whole expression is not complete
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Targets next PHP 8.x.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None.

==== To Opcache ====
Would require opcache changes.

===== Future Scope =====

==== Splat operator ====

Grouping labels into a comma-separated list could benefit from splat operator replacing a bunch of labels.

<code php>
<?php

$labels = ["foo", "bar"];
$kind = "bar";

switch ($kind) {
    case ...$labels:
        echo "matched 'foo' or 'bar', requires further manual verification";
        break;
}

echo switch ($kind) {
    case ...$labels => "matched 'foo' or 'bar', requires further manual verification";
};
</code>

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required.

The vote is a straight Yes/No vote for accepting the RFC and merging the patch.

===== Patches and Tests =====
Not implemented.

A volunteer to help with implementation would be desirable.

===== Implementation =====
