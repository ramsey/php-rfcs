====== PHP RFC: Replacing current json extension with jsond ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2015-01-01
  * Author: Jakub Zelenka, bukka@php.net
  * Status: Draft


===== Introduction =====
The current Json Parser in the json extension does not have a free license which is a problem for many Linux distros. The extension code is also very old which makes it difficult for further improvements. There also are some implementation decisions that makes the performance worse than it should be

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to replace current json extension with code that is based on the PECL jsond extension (it's not exactly the same code as there are some modification for PHP 7).

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
  * Rejected ECMA-404 and RFC 7159 incompatible number formats in json_decode string
    * top level (PHP json_decode check): 07, 0xff, .1, -.1
    * all (JSON_Parser): [1.], [1.e1]

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7
