====== PHP RFC: Add pecl_http to core ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2014-08-19
  * Author: Michael Wallner, <mike@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/pecl_http

===== Introduction =====
A discussion whether it is feasible to add [[http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http|pecl_http]] v2 to the core.

===== Proposal =====
Providing the functionality of pecl_http with the core distribution.

See [[https://github.com/php/pecl-http-pecl_http|the Github repo]] for the sources, [[http://devel-m6w6.rhcloud.com/mdref/|the online markdown reference]] for the complete userland API and [[http://dev.iworks.at/ext-http/lcov/http/|the LCOV code coverage report]] for a glance on test coverage.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP7, resp. git:master

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====

WEB:
  * pecl_http adds processing for json request bodies into $_POST

==== To Opcache ====

TODO:
  * Verify RFC's compatibility with opcache.

==== New Constants ====

pecl_http does not introduce new global constants.

==== php.ini Defaults ====

  * http.etag.mode => crc32b

===== Open Issues =====

pecl_http has not been ported to PHPNG yet.

pecl_http depends on additional pecl extensions which also would have to be included somehow:

  * [[http://pecl.php.net/package/raphf|Resource and persistent handle factory]]
    * [[http://devel-m6w6.rhcloud.com/mdref/raphf|Userland reference]]
    * [[http://php.github.io/pecl-php-raphf/|Internal reference]]
    * [[http://dev.iworks.at/ext-http/lcov/raphf/|LCOV code coverage report]]
  * [[http://pecl.php.net/package/propro|Property proxy]]
    * [[http://devel-m6w6.rhcloud.com/mdref/propro|Userland reference]]
    * [[http://php.github.io/pecl-php-propro/|Internal reference]]
    * [[http://dev.iworks.at/ext-http/lcov/propro/|LCOV code coverage report]]

The PHP manual still hosts the docs for pecl_http-v1 and it's not been decided how to handle the documentation of pecl_http-v2.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

The http: stream wrapper is unaffected by pecl_http.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

A simple yes/no vote with a 50%+1 majority needed for acceptance.
