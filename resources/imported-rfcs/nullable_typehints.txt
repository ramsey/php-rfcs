====== PHP RFC: Declaring Nullable Types ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2014-04-10 
  * Author: Levi Morrison <levim@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullable_typehints

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes new syntax to allow type declarations to also accept <php>null</php>. 

Consider the function:

<PHP>
function foo(DateTime $time, $a) {
    // unimportant
}
</PHP>

In this situation you are not allowed to pass <php>null</php> to <php>$time</php> but can perhaps provide a sensible default; this proposal allows you do pass <php>null</php> without re-ordering the parameters.

===== Proposal =====
This proposal adds a mark ''?'' to indicate that a type can also be <php>null</php>. This is allowed for any declared type including <php>array</php> and <php>callable</php>.

==== Inheritance in parameters ====

The ''?'' marker cannot be removed in subclass; it can be added if not present in a superclass.

<PHP>
// Valid use: loosing the nullable marker in a parameter:
interface Fooable {
    function foo(Fooable $f);
}
interface Foo extends Fooable {
    function foo(?Fooable $f);
}
</PHP>

<PHP>
// Invalid use: tightening the nullable marker in a parameter:
interface Fooable {
    function foo(?Fooable $f);
}
interface Foo extends Fooable {
    function foo(Fooable $f);
}
</PHP>

==== Return Types ====
If the [[rfc:returntypehinting|RFC for Declaring Return Types]] passes, then nullable types would be extended to return types as well:

<PHP>
// Possible usage of ? modifier for both parameters and return types
class BinaryTree {
    public $value;
    private $right;
    private $left;

    function right(): ?BinaryTree {
        return $this->left;
    }
    function left(): ?BinaryTree {
        return $this->left;
    }

    function setRight(?BinaryTree $t) {
        $this->right = $t;
    }
    function setLeft(?BinaryTree $t) {
        $this->left = $t;
    }
}
</PHP>

=== Inheritance in Return Types ===

In return types the ''?'' marker would behave differently during inheritance than a parameter type would. In a return type, the null marker can be removed by a subclass, but it cannot be added:
<PHP>
interface Fooable {
    function foo(): ?Fooable;
}
interface StrictFooable extends Fooable {
    function foo(): Fooable; // valid
}
</PHP>
<PHP>
interface Fooable {
    function foo(): Fooable;
}
interface LooseFooable extends Fooable {
    function foo(): ?Fooable; // invalid
}
</PHP>

==== Differences from Default Parameters ====
The null marker does not have a default; it does not default to <php>null</php>. The following snippet would result in an error:
<PHP>
function f(?callable $p) {}
f(); // invalid; function f does not have a default
</PHP>

The ''?'' marker can be placed on any parameter position, provided it does not violate inheritance rules:
<PHP>
function f(?callable $p, $a) {} // valid
</PHP>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
TODO 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
5.7 or 6.0

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
TODO 

==== To Existing Extensions ====
TODO 

==== New Constants ====
This RFC does not propose any new constants or ini defaults.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values
  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
TODO

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This RFC modifies the PHP language syntax and therefore requires a two-third majority of votes.

===== Patches and Tests =====
There is currently no patch.

===== Implementation =====
TODO

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====
