====== PHP RFC: Declaring Nullable Types ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2014-04-10 
  * Author: Levi Morrison <levim@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullable_typehints

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes new syntax to allow type declarations to also accept <php>null</php>. 

Consider the function:

<PHP>
function foo(DateTime $time, $a) {
    // unimportant
}
</PHP>

In this situation you are not allowed to pass <php>null</php> to <php>$time</php> but can perhaps provide a sensible default; this proposal allows you do pass <php>null</php> without re-ordering the parameters.

===== Proposal =====

This proposal adds a mark <php>?</php> to indicate that a type can also be <php>null</php>. This would be allowed for any declared type including <php>array</php> and <php>callable</php>

The following function could be called as ''foo(null, $a)''.
<PHP>
function foo(?DateTime $time, $a) {
    // unimportant
}
</PHP>

Before this RFC you would have to refactor it to one of two options (aside from removing the type declaration):

<PHP>
// Option 1: reordering parameters and adding = null
function foo($a, DateTime $time = null) {
    // unimportant
}

// Option 2: adding default to both parameters
function foo(DateTime $time = null, $a = '') {
    // unimportant
}
</PHP>

==== Return Types ====
If the [[rfc:returntypehinting|RFC for Declaring Return Types]] passes, then nullable types would be extended to return types as well:

<PHP>
// Example of Where
class BinaryTree {
    public $value;
    private $right;
    private $left;

    function right(): ?BinaryTree {
        return $this->left;
    }
    function left(): ?BinaryTree {
        return $this->left;
    }

    function setRight(?BinaryTree $t) {
        $this->right = $t;
    }
    function setLeft(?BinaryTree $t) {
        $this->left = $t;
    }
}
</PHP>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

TODO 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

5.7 or 6.0

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====

TODO 

==== To Existing Extensions ====
TODO 

==== New Constants ====
This RFC does not propose any new constants or ini defaults.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values
  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
TODO

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This RFC modifies the PHP language syntax and therefore requires a two-third majority of votes.

===== Patches and Tests =====
There is currently no patch.

===== Implementation =====

TODO

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====
