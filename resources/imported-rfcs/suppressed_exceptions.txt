====== PHP RFC: Suppressed Exceptions ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-04-04

===== Introduction =====

Currently in PHP there are some scenarios where information about exceptions can be lost, particularly when multiple exceptions occur in block of code. For example when retrying network requests.

<code php>
function fetchDataOverNetwork() {

  for ($i = 0; $i < MAX_ATTEMPTS; $i++) {
    try {
      // Some operation that may throw 
      return foo(); 
    }
    catch (NetworkException $networkException) {
      // can't do anything with $networkException here
    }
  }
  
  // Information about $networkExceptions is lost.
  throw new FetchDataException("Failed to get data");
}
</code>

Another example where an exception is thrown trying to release an acquired resource:

<code php>
$resource = acquireSomeResource();

try {
  foo($resource);
}
catch (FooException $fooException) {
  try {
    // try to release resource cleanly
    $resource->close();
    throw $fooException;
  }
  catch (ResourceException $resourceException) {
    // The information about $resourceException is lost.
    throw $fooException;
  }
}

</code>


Although PHP has the capability of adding a 'previous' exception when creating a new exception, it is inappropriate to do that in these examples as that is meant to be used for transforming one exception to another type.

Additionally the 'previous' exception can only store information about one exception, not an arbitrary number of exceptions.



===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to add two methods to allow storing and retrieving of suppressed exceptions to each of the base exception classes \Exception and \Error with the signatures


<code php>
public void addSuppressed(Throwable exception);

public getSuppressed(): Throwable[];
</code>

These signatures would be similar to those in [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html#addSuppressed-java.lang.Throwable-)


These suppressed exceptions can be handled or logged appropriately where the exception is caught.



Example when retrying network requests.

<code php>
function fetchDataOverNetwork() {

  $networkExceptions = [];

  for ($i = 0; $i < MAX_ATTEMPTS; $i++) {
    try {
      // Some operation that may throw 
      return foo(); 
    }
    catch (NetworkException $ne) {
      $networkExceptions[] = $ne;
    }
  }

  $fdException = new FetchDataException("Failed to get data");
  
  foreach ($networkExceptions as $networkException) {
    $fdException->addSuppressed($networkException);
  }
  
  throw $fdException;
}
</code>


Example when cleaning up resource
<code php>
$resource = acquireSomeResource();

try {
  foo($resource);
}
catch (FooException $fooException) {
  try {
    // try to release resource cleanly
    $resource->close();
    throw $fe;
  }
  catch (ResourceException $resourceException) {
    $fe->addSuppressed($resourceException);        
    throw $fooException;
  }
}
</code>


===== Why not add suppressed in constructor? =====

As per the resource exception sometimes it is necessary to add suppressed exception to an exception that has been caught and is going to be re-thrown. 


===== Why not just use the 'previous' exception =====

The constructor for Exceptions allows a 'previous' exception to be set in the constructor. This is typically used for catching generic exceptions and throw a more specific exception:

<code php>
function foo() 
{
	try {
		bar();
	}
	// LogicException is part of core
	catch (LogicException $le) {
		throw new FooException(
		  "Failed calling bar:",
		  0,
		  $le
		)
	}
}
</code>

In this example, only one thing has gone wrong unexpectedly and so the FooException and LogicException are representing a single unexpected error. As it is a single error, this exception only needs to be logged once.

In the resource exception example, the fact that there was an exception calling 'foo' and the fact that there was an exception releasing the resource are two separate errors, that should be logged separately.




Additionally, the 'previous' exception can only be set in the constructor, but users may want to re-throw the initial exception, rather than create a new exception. 


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

This has the potential to break user's custom exception serializing and deserializing. Although individually these would not be major breaks, they would still be more appropriate to have at a major release than a minor release, hence this RFC targets PHP 8.
