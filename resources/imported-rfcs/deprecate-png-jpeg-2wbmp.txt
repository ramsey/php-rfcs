====== PHP RFC: Deprecate png2wbmp() and jpeg2wbmp() ======
  * Version: 1.1

  * Author: Christoph M. Becker, cmb@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

''png2wbmp()'' and ''jpeg2wbmp()'' are the only direct image format conversion functions available in ext/gd what makes them rather special, particularly as libgd doesn't offer any such functions ((instead they are defined in the libgd binding using libgd's image reading and writing functions)). Furthermore WBMP ((Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap Format)) has been invented to support WAP ((Wireless Application Protocol)), which appears to be mostly obsolete nowadays.

===== Proposal =====

Therefore I propose to deprecate the ''png2wbmp()'' and ''jpeg2wbmp()'' functions as of PHP 7.2, and to remove them as of PHP 8.0. During the deprecation phase calling either function should emit an E_DEPRECATED error.

The main benefit in doing so would be easier maintainance of the libgd bindings ([[https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-7.0.12/ext/gd/gd.c#L4018-L4215|_php_image_convert()]] alone accounts for rougly 200 lines). An additional benefit would be to have a slightly cleaner and less confusing API (Why are there no other conversion functions? Why don't these functions follow the general "image" prefix rule?)

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Obviously, code still using png2wbmp() or jpeg2wbmp() would break. However, fallback functions could easily [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/96366|implemented in userland]]. The supposedly long deprecation period should give users ample time to cater to the removal.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

  * Deprecation as of next PHP 7.x
  * Removal as of next major (supposedly PHP 8.0)

===== Open Issues =====

Currently none.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

''imagewbmp()'' and ''image2wbmp()'' are not subject of this RFC, and as such their functionality will remain unmodified.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Deprecate and remove the functions: yes or no.

This RFC requires a 50%+1 majority.

===== Patches and Tests =====

PR implementing the deprecation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2164.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
