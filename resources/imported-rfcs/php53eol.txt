===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is to define when PHP 5.3 serie won't be supported anymore. 

As PHP 5.3 was released before the new release process was defined and implemented, we have to define a clear EOL ((End of Life)).

Even if the 5.3 release manager already stated something about the status of PHP 5.3, it is critical for us to have a clear and open decision. PHP 5.3 is still the most widely (maintained) branch and many projects rely on it as a minimum version. It is also important to keep in mind that we won't have this problem anymore in 5.4 or later and the life cycle is already clearly defined by the [[rfc/releaseprocess|release process RFC]].  
===== Two years, one normal fixes and one security fixes only =====
