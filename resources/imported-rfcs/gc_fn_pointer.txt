===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes to change ''gc_collect_cycles'' into a hookable function pointer.
The goal is to allow extensions to hook into garbage collection for profiling.

===== Proposal =====

PHP Profilers usually hook into zend_execute and zend_execute_internal to
measure execution time before and after the call. Because Garbage Collection is
triggered during ''ALLOC_ZVAL'' and ''FREE_ZVAL'' (5.*) and during variable/object
release this can happen "undeterministically" in a random function call from the perspective of the developer. This skews reporting actual execution times.

Turning garbage collection into a function pointer would allow to measure the time
spent in garbage collection and substract that from the actual function calls.
This would allow Profilers to correct time spent in execution for accidentally
triggered GC. It would also allow to give hints about inefficient garbage collection
runs that should prompt a developer to consider calling ''gc_disable()'' in userland.

A default implementation ''zend_gc_collect_cycles'' will implement the current behavior.

Adam tested the performance of this change and there was no measurable overhead:

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

No changes to userland.

This changes the signature of ''gc_collect_cycles'' in ''Zend/zend_gc.h'' file and should therefore target only 7.0

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

- PHP 7.0
- 5.7 (if there is going to be one)

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None

==== To Opcache ====
None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

This does not actually add profiling to garbage collection, it only allows extensions to build this on top.

===== Patches and Tests =====
