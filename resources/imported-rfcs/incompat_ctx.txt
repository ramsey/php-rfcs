====== Request for Comments: Remove calls with incompatible Context ======
An RFC for deprecating and removing <php>$this</php> from incompatible context.

  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2012-07-30
  * Author: Gustavo Lopes
  * Status: Deprecation implemented in PHP 5.6
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/incompat_ctx

===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes deprecating (in PHP 5.5) and removing (in the next version) the "<php>$this</php> from incompatible context" feature.

===== What this proposal is not about =====

This proposal is not about removing static calls to instance methods or instance-like calls to static methods.

===== The feature =====

To be clear, the feature I'm proposing to remove is this:

<code php>
class A {
    function foo() { var_dump(get_class($this)); }
}
class B {
   function bar() { A::foo(); }
}
$b = new B;
$b->bar(); //string(1) "B"
</code>

Internal methods cannot be called in this fashion.

===== The Change ====

Even though I think an error at call site would be the most useful to the user, the most sensible option is to just have <php>$this === null</php> inside the callee, like when you do:

<code php>
class A { function foo() {} }
A::foo(); // E_STRICT
</code>

===== Rationale =====

Method implementations almost always assume that $this refers to an instance of a compatible type. When they are called with an incompatible <php>$this</php>, there'll a bug most of the time. The only warning is an <php>E_STRICT</php> message, which many people have disabled.

Because this feature is surprising and little-known, a simple error like calling Class::foo() instead of ::fooStatic() (when foo() and fooStatic() have similar names), by not failing on the call site, can be difficult to identify.

When combined with LSB, it can be even more difficult to identify. See https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62446


===== BC break =====

The break should be minor. I very much doubt there are many lines of code that rely on this feature. It has been discouraged with an <php>E_STRICT</php> since 2006 (see [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/6f76b170|6f76b170]]).

This feature, as noted in the [[http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_TRUNK/Zend/zend_vm_def.h?r=80497ea7dfade2ccd032ef65103c0a113338653a#2335|comment]], exists only for compatibility with PHP 4. Far more used legacy features, like register globals, have already been axed.

This feature can, however, be used to implement trait-like behavior, and I'm sure someone somewhere did such a thing.

===== Alternatives =====

Using traits is perhaps the easiest and cleanest way to replace code that relies on the feature to be removed. Changing the code to use traits implies: 1) refactoring the instance methods called from incompatible contexts into a trait, 2) make the callers from incompatible contexts use the new trait, 3) change the call sites to use <php>$this->method()</php> instead of <php>OrigClass::method()</php>. Example:

<code php>
<?php
class A {
	function dumpClass() {
		var_dump(get_class($this));			 
	}
}
class B {
	function test() {
		A::dumpClass();
	}
}

$a = new A;
$b = new B;
$a->dumpClass();
$b->test();
</code>

would become:

<code php>
<?php
trait ATrait {
	function dumpClass() {
		var_dump(get_class($this));			 
	}
}
class A {
	use ATrait;
}
class B {
	use ATrait;
	function test() {
		$this->dumpClass();
	}
}

$a = new A;
$b = new B;
$a->dumpClass();
$b->test();
</code>

A worse solution, which relies on the possibility of calling instance methods statically would be using an extra parameter:

<code php>
<?php
class A {
	function dumpClass($obj=null) {
		if ($obj === null)
			$obj = $this;
		var_dump(get_class($obj));			 
	}
}
class B {
	function test() {
		A::dumpClass($this); //E_STRICT ($this would be NULL on callee)
	}
}

$a = new A;
$b = new B;
$a->dumpClass();
$b->test();
</code>

===== Vote =====

Voting ends not before Monday, January 28th 2013. The PHP language is ultimately changed, so a 2/3 majority is required.
