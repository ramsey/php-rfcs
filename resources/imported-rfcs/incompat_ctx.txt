===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes deprecating (in PHP 5.5) and removing (in the next version) the "<php>$this</php> from incompatible context" feature.

===== What this proposal is not about =====

This proposal is not about removing static calls to instance methods or instance-like calls to static methods.

===== The feature =====

To be clear, the feature I'm proposing to remove is this:

<code php>
class A {
    function foo() { var_dump(get_class($this)); }
}
class B {
   function bar() { A::foo(); }
}
$b = new B;
$b->bar(); //string(1) "B"
</code>

Internal methods cannot be called in this fashion.

===== Rationale =====

Method implementations almost always assume that $this refers to an instance of a compatible type. When they are called with an incompatible <php>$this</php>, there'll a bug most of the time. The only warning is an <php>E_STRICT</php> message, which many people have disabled.

Because this feature is surprising and little-known, a simple error like calling Class::foo() instead of ::fooStatic() (when foo() and fooStatic() have similar names), by not failing on the call site, can be difficult to identify.

When combined with LSB, it can be even more difficult to identify. See https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62446


===== BC break =====

The break should be minor. I very much doubt there are many lines of code that rely on this feature. It has been discouraged with an <php>E_STRICT</php> since 2006 (see [[https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/6f76b170|6f76b170]]).

This feature, as noted in the [[http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_TRUNK/Zend/zend_vm_def.h?r=80497ea7dfade2ccd032ef65103c0a113338653a#2335|comment]], exists only for compatibility with PHP 4. Far more used legacy features, like register globals, have already been axed.

This feature can, however, be used to implement trait-like behavior, and I'm sure someone somewhere did such a thing.

===== Changelog =====
