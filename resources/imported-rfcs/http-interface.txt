Standardizing and building an HTTP interface in PHP for allowing clients to implement their own custom Http Request/Response objects without having to wrap a plethora of HTTP functions/classes/libraries.

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes creating two standard HTTP interfaces in PHP core that users can implement in their own PHP code to utilize HTTP request and response capabilities and discard the superglobal $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, $_FILES, $_SERVER variables. Along with the interfaces a base HttpRequest and HttpResponse classes should be packaged with PHP so that users can extend or override such default behavior at will and with efficiency. If the user does not chose to implement their own HTTP classes using the HTTP interfaces then default behavior is relied upon by PHP (//i.e. no backwards incompatible changes//).

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes creating two standard Http interfaces (**HttpMessageReceive** and **HttpMessageSend**) in PHP core along with two base classes: **HttpRequest** and **HttpResponse** that handle all incoming and outgoing HTTP messages through a unified set of interfaces.

The ultimate goal of this proposal is to make HTTP message handling in PHP ubiquitous and conforming. Superglobal variables such as $_POST and $_GET are great, but they do not address many of the concerns that current web users are dealing with today such as RESTful APIs. Some RESTful APIs might rely on PUT and DELETE HTTP verbs (methods) to handle certain requests and PHP does not make dealing with such requests intuitive. So some users requested $_PUT and $_DELETE superglobals to be added to the list. However, this RFC does not propose such features. Instead, it is proposed to rid PHP of the super global variables entirely and make HTTP message processing a standard interface that can be implement by the user in any way they deem fit.

This greatly reduces the need to change core PHP for any form of edge cases that may rely on processing HTTP messages differently and improves the flexibility and extensibility of PHP's built-in message processing facilities. Further more, this removes the inefficiencies of reusing/reinitializing GPC variables in custom HttpRequest or HttpResponse classes. Additional benefits can be found in the filtering or validating of data through custom callbacks defined in the implementing class.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The default base class for HttpRequest will implement the existing behavior by populating GPC variables for now, which will leave no backwards incompatible changes in the language. The changes to GPC that affect this proposal are that they will no longer be populated by the Request itself, but left up to the implementing HttpRequest class. Thus users extending the class will be able to override the default behavior (leaving GPC unused if they see fit).
