===== Introduction =====

Arrays in PHP have long since supported trailing commas.

=== Trailing array commas ===
<code php>
$foo = [
    'foo',
    'bar',
];
</code>

This makes for clean diffs and easy appending of new values in user-land.

Unfortunately, the argument list for function/method declarations and calls do not share the same luxury.

=== Declarations raise a parse error ===
<code php>
// Parse error
function myFunc(
    $foo,
    $bar,
    ) {
  /* ... */
}
</code>

=== Calls raise a parse error ===
<code php>
// Parse error
myFunc(
    $foo,
    $bar,
    );
</code>

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes allowing function/method declarations and calls to allow for trailing commas in order to:

  - Offer a consistent API and match the existing array functionality.
  - Make it easy to append new arguments in user-land.
  - Have cleaner diffs (so only one line shows up as being modified when appending arguments instead of two).
  - Match what [[https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/commit/c1b7da6a4c128af5ddfc75f515c205de9f417a1e|HHVM did a while ago]].

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

This change would have no breaking changes.

===== Proposed PHP Version =====

PHP 7.1

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
