===== Introduction =====
Session ID is created by session internal bin_to_reabable() function. bin_to_readable() creates readable string from binary data depending. New session_create_id() uses bin_to_readable() to create user defined session ID string. Session ID may use 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', ',', '-'. Without session_create_id(), user has to implement their own bin_to_readable() in user land.

===== Proposal =====

Add session_create_id() function

  string session_create_id([string $prefix])

NOTE: Prefix length is not considered as a part of session.sid_length. Session ID length became 'prefix length' + session.sid_length. Total length must be less than 256 chars.

session_create_id() will create new session ID by

  * Default internal function(php_session_create_id()) when session is **NOT** active.
  * Save handler defined session ID creation function when session is active.
    * Additionally, if session ID validation function is defined, collision is detected.

Note: User defined session ID creation function(handler) is not documented, but it's there.
http://php.net/manual/en/book.session.php
<del>It's not documented because Object based save handler has non standard method name. i.e. create_sid() rather than createSid(). Rename will be proposed by different RFC.</del>(Documented after this RFC is created) If you would like to see how it is used, please refer to phpt files.

  * and so on


==== Use case ====

Prefix session ID by user id. This could be useful to search active session IDs for a user.

<code php>
<?php
function create_logged_in_session($uid) {
  // Mark obsolete session as obsolete. Timestamp based session management is mandatory.
  $_SESSION['OBSOLETE'] = time(); // Warn access to this session after a few minutes. Should be checked upon starting session.

  // Make sure old session does not have 'uid' in $_SESSION
  unset($_SESSION['uid']);

  // Session is active here. It is safe to generate new session ID while session is active,
  // because session ID collision is detected by session module if save handler implements session ID validation function.
  $sid = session_create_id($uid.'-');  

  // Save and close old session.
  session_commit(); 
  
  // use_strict_mode should be enabled by default for session security.
  // However, it must be disable to use custom session ID. 
  ini_set('session.use_strict_mode', false); 
  
  // Set your own session ID and start session.
  session_id($sid);
  // Collision is checked already in previous active session.
  session_start(); 
  
  // Error check
  if (session_id() !== $sid) {
    throw new Exception('Should not happen'); // Save handlers could do something cause this. This should never happen usually.
  }
  
  $_SESSION['uid'] = $uid;
}

function my_session_start() {
  // Should enable use_strict_mode for security reasons.
  ini_set('session.use_strict_mode', 1);

  session_start();
  
  // Check obsolete session
  if ($_SESSION['OBSOLETE'] < time() - 300) {
    throw new Exception('Obsolete session access. Possible security breach');
  } 
}
?>
</code>

If session data is stored in database, administrators are able to list active session per uid easily and efficiently.
