===== Introduction =====
Session ID is created by session internal bin_to_reabable() function. bin_to_reabable() creates readable string from binary data depending. New session_create_id() uses bin_to_reabable() to create user defined session ID string. Session ID may use 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', ',', '-'. Without session_create_id(), user has to implement their own bin_to_reable() in userland.
