====== PHP RFC: Power Operator ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2013-11-23
  * Author: Tjerk Meesters, datibbaw@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/pow-operator

===== Introduction =====

This proposal covers the exponential operator  to complement the [[http://php.net/pow|pow()]] function. A few reasons why this could be useful:

  * Easier to read and shorter to write.
  * Avoids a function call.
  * Takes advantage of GMP overloading.
  * Can be found in other languages.

===== Proposal =====

The new operator allows writing exponents like this:

<code php>
echo 2 ** 3; // 8
</code>

It also supports [[operator_overloading_gmp|GMP overloading]]:

<code php>
$base = gmp_init(2);
$exponent = 3;
var_dump($base ** $exponent);

// output
object(GMP)#3 (1) {
  ["num"]=>
  string(1) "8"
}
</code>

**Operator precedence and associativity**

The operator precedence is higher than the bitwise not (~) and lower than array dereferencing. The proposed associativity is right. The behaviour is illustrated with the following cases:

<code php>
echo 2 ** 3 ** 2; // 512
echo -3 ** 2; // -9
echo ~3 ** 2; // -10
</code>

===== Discussion =====

==== Precedence ====

> Shouldn't ''-3 <nowiki>**</nowiki> 2'' be evaluated as ''(-1) <nowiki>**</nowiki> 2'' to avoid confusion?

This falls outside of the scope of this RFC, because this would require the unary minus to take precedence. Note that ''1 - 3 <nowiki>**</nowiki> 2'' would still get yield as ''-8'' if that were implemented.

==== Associativity ====

> Should ''2 <nowiki>**</nowiki> 3 <nowiki>**</nowiki> 2'' yield ''64'' (left associative) or ''512'' (right associative)?

**Languages with left associative exponential operator**

  * VB (not by choice imho)
  * Basic
  * Octave
  * Matlab
  * D
  * ColdFusion

** Languages with right associative exponential operator**

  * Haskell
  * R
  * F#
  * Ruby
  * Perl
  * Python
  * Mathematica
  * Freemat
  * Scilab
  * Tcl
  * Cobol
  * Fortran
  * Sage
  * Bash

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

Next PHP 5.x

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

The opcode ''ZEND_POW <165>'' is added.

External extensions such as [[http://pecl.php.net/package/vld|vld]] or [[https://github.com/krakjoe/phpdbg|phpdbg]] would have to be updated, but I'm not aware of any core extensions that would otherwise be affected.

===== Open Issues =====

None.


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

There's currently a debate on whether the operator should be left associative (such as VB) or right associative (Python). If unresolved, the choice may appear in the voting options:

  * Yes, right associative; ''2 <nowiki>**</nowiki> 3 <nowiki>**</nowiki> 2 == 512''
  * Yes, left associative; '' 2 <nowiki>**</nowiki> 3 <nowiki>**</nowiki> 2 == 64''
  * No
