====== PHP RFC: Implement socket_getaddrinfo() ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-08-08
  * Author: David Walker (dave@mudsite.com)
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/socket_getaddrinfo

===== Introduction =====
This RFC targets a reported feature request in [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72733|#72733]].  The request is that PHP expose the C level function getaddrinfo().  This is a missing nice piece to the current socket library.  When dealing with IP variable networks it would be beneficial to allow libc to tell us what methods of connecting/listening would be most appropriate given a set of hints.

===== Proposals =====
I'm starting this RFC with 2 proposed solutions, which are very similar, but I'm not sure which is preferable for implementation.
==== Proposal 1 ====
The implementation[[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/socket_getaddrinfo#references|[1]]] I'm proposing implements 5 new socket_* functions.  ''socket_getaddrinfo()'' will return an array of resources, with each resource corresponding to each returned addrinfo.  The next two implemented methods ''socket_addrinfo_bind()'', and ''socket_addrinfo_connect()'', would be used to bind, or connect, to a given resource rather than make the user go through the process of creating the socket and connect/binding themselves.  The fourth function is a free'r if you'd want to free the resources before end of script.  And the last to pull info from the addrinfo resource.
<file php>
socket_getaddrinfo(string node[, mixed service, array hints]) : array
socket_addrinfo_connect(resource $addrinfo) : resource
socket_addrinfo_bind(resource $addrinfo) : resource
socket_addrinfo(resource $addrinfo) : array
socket_addrinfo_close(sockaddrresource sockaddr) : null
</file>

<file php>
<?php
$addrinfo = socket_getaddrinfo('127.0.0.1', 2000, array('ai_family' => AI_INET, 'ai_socktype' => SOCK_STREAM));
$sockaddr = reset($addrinfo);
if (!$sockaddr) die ("No Valid Socket Types");
$sock = socket_addrinfo_bind($sockaddr);
// ^^ $sock is a socket resource that is bound to 127.0.0.1:2000 using TCP/IP ready for reading
foreach ($addrinfo as $sockaddr) {
    socket_addrinfo_close($sockaddr);
}
</file>

**Pro**
  * Doesn't change current functions
**Con**
  * Adds duplicative functions
  * Isn't very 'C' like in how it's used

==== Proposal 2 ====
This attempt [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/socket_getaddrinfo#references|[2]]] is similar to the first, and tries to be a hybrid approach.  It alters the default signature of socket_(connect|bind) to change the second argument to mixed.  This method is the most C-like of the 3.  After playing with all three, this is my preferred, but changing default signatures is not always the best idea.

<file php>
socket_getaddrinfo(string $node[, mixed $service, array $hints]) : array
socket_connect(resource $sock, mixed $address_or_addrinfo[, int $port = 0]) : bool
socket_bind(resource $sock, string $address_or_addrinfo[, int port = 0]) : bool
socket_addrinfo_close(resourece $addrinfo) : null
</file>

<file php>
<?php
$addrinfo = socket_getaddrinfo('127.0.0.1', 2000, array('ai_family' => AI_INET, 'ai_socktype' => SOCK_STREAM));
$sockaddr = reset($addrinfo);
if (!$sockaddr) die ("No Valid Socket Types");
$sock = socket_create($sockaddr['ai_family'], $sockaddr['ai_socktype'], $sockaddr['ai_protocol']);
$sock = socket_bind($sock, $sockaddr);
// ^^ $sock is a socket resource that is bound to 127.0.0.1:2000 using TCP/IP ready for reading
foreach ($addrinfo as $sockaddr) {
    socket_addrinfo_close($sockaddr);
}
</file>

**Pro**
  * Used much more like how C implements socket()/bind()/connect()
**Con**
  * Changes default signatures of socket_bind()/socket_connect()

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
New functionality; BC problems in changing default socket function signatures for Proposal 2.  Although code that exists today ought not to have BC issues.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 7.x (currently 7.2)

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Socket acquired new functionality

==== To Opcache ====
None

==== New Constants ====
Exposing the AI_* family of constants.

===== Open Issues =====

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Vote to implement the new functions, would require a 2/3 majority.
