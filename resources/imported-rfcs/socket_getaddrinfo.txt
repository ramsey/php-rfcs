===== Introduction =====
This RFC targets a reported feature request in [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72733|#72733]].  The request is that PHP expose the C level function getaddrinfo().  This is a missing nice piece to the current socket library.  When dealing with variable networks it would be beneficial to allow libc to tell us what methods of connecting/listening would be most appropriate given a set of hints.

===== Proposal =====
The implementation[[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/socket_getaddrinfo#references|[1]]] I'm proposing implements 4 new functions.  ''socket_addrinfo_lookup()'' will return an array of resources, with each resource corresponding to each returned addrinfo.  The next two implemented methods ''socket_addrinfo_bind()'', and ''socket_addrinfo_connect()'', would be used to bind, or connect, to a given resource rather than make the user go through the process of creating the socket and connect/binding themselves.  The last, ``socket_addrinfo_explain`` is to convert the resource to an array for examination.
<file php>
socket_addrinfo_lookup(string node[, mixed service, array hints]) : array
socket_addrinfo_connect(resource $addrinfo) : resource
socket_addrinfo_bind(resource $addrinfo) : resource
socket_addrinfo_explain(resource $addrinfo) : array
</file>

<file php>
<?php
$addrinfo = socket_addrinfo_lookup('127.0.0.1', 2000, array('ai_family' => AI_INET, 'ai_socktype' => SOCK_STREAM));
$sockaddr = reset($addrinfo);
if (!$sockaddr) die ("No Valid Socket Types");
$sock = socket_addrinfo_bind($sockaddr);
// ^^ $sock is a socket resource that is bound to 127.0.0.1:2000 using TCP/IP ready for reading
</file>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
New functionality; no BC issues.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 7.x (currently 7.2)

===== RFC Impact =====

==== New Constants ====
Exposing the AI_* family of constants.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Vote to implement the new functionality, would require a 2/3 majority.
