====== PHP RFC: final class Vector ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2021-09-16
  * Author: Tyson Andre, tandre@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7488
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/vector

===== Introduction =====

PHP's native ''array'' type is rare among programming language in that it is used as an associative map of values, but also needs to support lists of values.
In order to support both use cases, additional memory is needed to track keys ([[https://www.npopov.com/2014/12/22/PHPs-new-hashtable-implementation.html|around twice as much as is needed to just store the values]], for non-reference counted values) .


It would be useful to have an efficient variable-length container in the standard library for the following reasons: 

  - To guarantee to application authors that the values really are a list without gaps,
  - To save memory in applications or libraries that may need to store many lists of values (both in userland and in native code written in php-src/PECLs), and
  - To provide a better alternative to ''ArrayObject'' and ''SplFixedArray'' for use cases that require variable sized list collections that can be passed by value.

===== Proposal =====
This proposes to add the class ''final class Vector'' to PHP.

Similarly to vectors in other languages, this is backed by a memory-efficient representation (raw C array of values with a size and capacity) and provides constant amortized-time push/pop operations.

Similarly to ''ArrayObject'', the ''$x[] = $value'' shorthand for appending to the Vector is supported in addition to ''ArrayAccess'' functionality.

<code php>
final class Vector implements IteratorAggregate, Countable, JsonSerializable, ArrayAccess
{
    /**
     * Construct a Vector from an iterable.
     *
     * When $preserveKeys is false, the values will be reindexed without gaps starting from 0
     * When $preserveKeys is true, any gaps in the keys of the iterable will be filled in with null,
     * and negative indices or non-integer indices will be rejected and cause an Exception.
     */
    public function __construct(iterable $iterator = [], bool $preserveKeys = true) {}
    public function getIterator(): InternalIterator {}
    public function count(): int {}
    public function capacity(): int {}
    public function shrinkToFit(): void {}
    public function clear(): void {}
    public function setSize(int $size): void {}

    public function __serialize(): array {}
    public function __unserialize(array $data): void {}
    public static function __set_state(array $array): Vector {}

    public function push(mixed $value): void {}
    public function pop(): mixed {}

    public function toArray(): array {}
    // Strictly typed, unlike offsetGet/offsetSet
    public function valueAt(int $offset): mixed {}
    public function setValueAt(int $offset, mixed $value): void {}

    public function offsetGet(mixed $offset): mixed {}
    public function offsetExists(mixed $offset): bool {}
    public function offsetSet(mixed $offset, mixed $value): void {}
    // Throws because unset and null are different things, unlike SplFixedArray
    public function offsetUnset(mixed $offset): void {}

    public function indexOf(mixed $value): int|false {}
    public function contains(mixed $value): bool {}

    public function map(callable $callback): Vector {}
    /**
     * Returns the subset of elements of the Vector satisfying the predicate.
     *
     * If the value returned by the callback is truthy
     * (e.g. true, non-zero number, non-empty array, truthy object, etc.),
     * this is treated as satisfying the predicate.
     *
     * @param null|callable(mixed):mixed $callback
     */
    public function filter(?callable $callback = null): Vector {}

    public function jsonSerialize(): array {}
}

===== Implementation Choices =====

==== Global Namespace ====

This maintains consistency with the namespace used for general-purpose collections already in the SPL (as well as relatively recent additions such as ''WeakReference'' and ''WeakMap''). Other recent additions to PHP such as ''ReflectionIntersectionType'' in PHP 8.1 have also continued to use the global namespace when adding classes with functionality related to other classes.

==== Lack of Name Prefix ====

    - Short names are more convenient to remember/use.
    - Possible future additions such as a Deque/Queue based on a efficient C array representation rather than a linked list wouold conflict with existing Spl names such as ''SplQueue'', ''SplStack'', etc.

==== Accepting an iterable ====

This is similar to the way the existing classes ''ArrayObject::__construct'' and ''SplFixedArray::fromArray''.

End users may be surprised if integer keys are not the same as the ones passed in by default (e.g. if keys were unset or inserted out of order), which is why ''$preserve_keys = true'' is the default.

Unlike ''SplFixedArray'', this is not a fixed size, which is why this accepts an iterable instead of a size. Accepting a mix of different types (''iterable|int'') is not done because it would make code harder to reason about when types are missing or inaccurate.

''setSize'' can be used to create a vector of a certain size after instantiating an empty vector. Array library helpers such as ''array_fill'' or ''range'' may also be useful.

==== Final Class ====

If this were extensible, this would have the following drawbacks

    - Not have as strong guarantees to readers of code (or even opcache, if optimizations were added targeting opcache) that elements were actually a vector or that certain methods would/wouldn't throw certain exceptions.
    - Require more memory and runtime checks to check if this was the original class or a subclass.
    - [[https://bugs.php.net/search.php?search_for=SplFixedArray&boolean=0&limit=30&order_by=&direction=DESC&cmd=display&status=All&bug_type=All&project=All&php_os=&phpver=&cve_id=&assign=&author_email=&bug_age=0&bug_updated=0&commented_by=|Be more likely to have discovered or undiscovered bugs]] due to userland extensions of ''Vector''

==== push/pop ====

This is consistent with the name used for ''array_push()''/''array_pop()''

Other naming choices were chosen to be consistent with existing functionality in ''SplFixedArray''/''ArrayObject'' where reasonable.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The class name ''\Vector'' is now used by PHP, and it will be a compilation error to declare classlikes of the same name in the global namespace since the class already exists.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
8.2

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Opcache ====
None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
PHP's type system remains unchanged (e.g. ''array'') - ''final class Vector'' is a class and instances are ordinary objects.

===== Benchmarks =====

This is a contrived benchmark for estimating the performance of building/reading variable-sized arrays of different sizes, when the final size would be unknown on 64-bit PHP (it is known here).

Read time is counted separately from create+destroy time. This is a total over all iterations, and the instrumentation adds to the time needed.

''SplFixedArray'' doesn't have a push method (conceptually, it hasn't made sense for a data structure described as a fixed size array), and this benchmark would be faster if it did.
''SplStack'' uses ''foreach'' for read benchmarking because the random access of ''SplStack'' is ''O(n)'' (linear time) in a linked list.

''Vector'' is faster than the other object data structures currently available in the SPL.

==== Adding a native type instead (is_vec) ====

https://externals.io/message/109760#109812

<blockquote>
Yes, sorry – Hack introduced the vec type (with value semantics) in 2016
after they'd experimented first with Vector (object semantics). Use of
Vector is now discouraged.

Details here: https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/6451

FB/Hack appears to be in the multi-year process of moving all PHP arrays to
one of [vec/dict/keyset]. *That's likely not an option for PHP itself,* but
having the option of a vec equivalent (in this proposal "list") would
make sense, I think.
</blockquote>

Adding a new type to php as a non-class is a massive undertaking for php-src itself and extension authors. It would not work with a lot of existing code that handled arrays and objects - I expect that ''is_vec'' would be a separate check from ''is_object'' and ''is_array'', etc. This is part of why PHP 8.1 enum classes are an object type rather than a distinct type

See https://www.npopov.com/2015/05/05/Internal-value-representation-in-PHP-7-part-1.html for how php represents values internally.

That would also require a lot more familiarity than I have with opcache and the JIT assembly compiler, and I expect it would be more controversial due to not working with existing code.
For a language such as Hack where feature development is done by one company(Facebook), major language redesigns and breaking changes would be much easier than for PHP, with users/developers from many different backgrounds (and a focus on backward compatibility).
Additionally, adding a class doesn't prevent adding a vec/list in the future - for example, HHVM has both vec and https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/reference/class/HH.Vector/ and ''HH\Vector'' remains usable, PHP has both array and ArrayObject, etc.

Also, even if a type ''vec'' or ''array'' were added, ''vec'' and ''array'' would be distinct types - a vec couldn't be passed to a parameter that expected an array reference (or returned in a return value), because later adding a string array key (in the parameter or return value) would be a runtime error.
