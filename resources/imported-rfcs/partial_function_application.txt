===== Introduction =====
Partial function application is the process of fixing (or applying) only some of the arguments to a function call and leaving the remainder to be provided at a later point, either by further application or invocation.

This technique has two main, complementary benefits:

  - It allows developers to "fill in" a function call over time as its arguments become available, in any order.
  - It allows developers to reference a function directly, by name, with or without providing some of its arguments in the process.

A simple example of where that is beneficial would be in array application functions, for example: 

<code php>
$result = array_map(do_stuff(?), $arr);
</code>

===== Proposal =====

This RFC adds support for partial application via a new argument placeholder, ''?''.  At any given call site (where one would call a function, method, or any other ''callable''), the developer may replace one or more of the function arguments with an argument placeholder.  If so, then rather than applying arguments to the function in-place, the engine will instead construct and return a ''Closure'' object that captures the evaluated arguments by value.  That ''Closure'' object will have a signature that matches the original function being invoked, with the applied arguments removed.

The ''Closure'' may then be invoked at a later time with the remaining arguments.

<PHP>
function whole($one, $two) {
    /* ... */
}

$partial = whole(?, 2);
</PHP>

''$partial'' now has the prototype:

<PHP>
function($one) {
   /* ... */
}
</PHP>

this process is logically equivalent to:

<code php>
$partial = fn($one) => whole($one, 2);
</code>

At the call site (when the Closure is invoked), the engine will invoke the function originally being called at the application site, with the arguments positioned as resolved at the application site (this is important for named parameters). The arguments provided at the call site will be taken for any missing or extra arguments:


<PHP>
function whole($one, $two) { /* ... */ }

// equivalent to calling whole(1, 2, 3)
$result = whole(?, 2)(1, 3); 
</PHP>

==== Types ====

Type declarations are retained, as are parameter names (e.g. for reflection.)

<PHP>
function f(int $x, int $y): int {}

$partial = f(?, 42);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$partial = function(int $x): int {
    return f($x, 42);
};
</PHP>


==== Variables/References ====

Variable arguments are ''use''d, and done so by reference if specified in the called function definition.

<PHP>
function f($value, &$ref) {}
 
$array = ['arg' => 0];

$f = f(?, $array['arg']);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP> 
$ref = &$array['arg'];
$f = function($value) use (&$ref) {
    return f($value, $ref);
};
</PHP>


==== Optional Parameters ====

Optional parameters remain optional, inheriting defaults.

<PHP>
function f($a = 0, $b = 1) {}

$f = f(?, 2);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$f = function($a = 0) {
    return f($a, 2);
};
</PHP>


==== func_num_args et al. ====

When a partial invokes ''func_num_args'', it shall behave as if the function was invoked directly, such that:

<PHP>
function f($a = 0, $b = 0, $c = 3, $d = 4) {
    echo func_num_args() . PHP_EOL;
    
    var_dump(
        $a, 
        $b, 
        $c, 
        $d);
}

f(1, 2);

$f = f(?);

$f(1, 2);
</PHP>

Would output:

<PHP>
2
int(1)
int(2)
int(3)
int(4)
2
int(1)
int(2)
int(3)
int(4)
</PHP>

==== Methods ====

The same logic applies to any callable, including an already partially applied function and to methods.  For example:

<code php>
class Action {
    public function volume(int $x, int $y, int $z): int {
        return $x * $y * $z;
    }

    static public function vol(int $x, int $y, int $z): int {
        return $x * $y * $z;
    }
}

$p1 = Action::vol(3, 5, ?);
print $p1(9); // Prints 135

$a = new Action();
$p2 = $a->volume(3, 5, ?);
print $p2(9); // Prints 135
</code>

==== Extra Arguments ====

You can pass as many additional arguments as you like when calling a function in PHP, beyond what's specified in the signature. When you pass extra arguments to the closure, or during partial application, they are passed along to the wrapped function.

<PHP>
function f($a, $b) {
    print_r(func_get_args());
}

$f = f(?, 2);
</PHP>

is actually akin to:

<PHP>
$f = function($a, ...$extraArgs) {
    return f($a, 2, ...$extraArgs);
};
</PHP>

(Though without unnecessary packing/unpacking, or ''$extraArgs'' appearing in reflection.)

So calling: ''$f(1, 3, 4)'' results in:

<PHP>
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2
    [2] => 3
    [3] => 4
)
</PHP>


==== Trailing Placeholders ====

At least one argument placeholder is necessary to indicate partial application; additional argument placeholders may be present but are unnecessary. This eases partial application of functions with long lists of optional parameters.

<PHP>
function f($m, $n, $o, $x = 0, $y = 0, $z = 0) {}

$f = f(1, ?);
</PHP>

The above snippet is roughly (minding the ''func_num_args'' section above) equivalent to:

<PHP>
$f = function($n, $o, $x = 0, $y = 0, $z = 0) {
    return f(1, $n, $o, $x, $y, $z);
};
</PHP>

As a side effect, that means that a callable of any arity can be partially applied without any binding with a single ''?''.  That is:

<code php>
class Foo {
  public function bar($a, $b, $c, $d, $e, $f, $g, $h): string { ... }
}

$f = new Foo();
$p = $f->bar(?);

// $p is now a partially applied function with the same 8 arguments
// as Foo::bar. Effectively there is no difference between now calling 
// $p(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and $foo->bar(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
</code>

That is especially useful when trying to use a method as a callable.

==== Extra Trailing Placeholders ====

Additional placeholders beyond a function's signature do not cause an error and have no additional impact, though effectively allow you to apply all arguments to a function to be called later.

<PHP>
$n = 1000000;

$log10ofn = log10($n, ?);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$log10ofn = function() use ($n) {
    return log10($n);
}
</PHP>


==== Variadic Functions ====

Variadic functions retain their signatures. Placeholders in a variadic position remain optional (there are no defaults, places not filled are simply not included in what's sent to the underlying function.) Fixed and placeholder arguments can be interleaved together.

<PHP>
function f(...$args) {
    print_r($args);
}

$f = f(?, 2, ?, 4, ?, 6);
$f(1, 3);
</PHP>

Would output:

<PHP>
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2
    [2] => 3
    [3] => 4
    [4] => 6
)
</PHP>

==== Named arguments ====

Named arguments may be used when creating a partial, or when calling it later.  The parameter names inherit to the partialed function.  However, regardless of the order the arguments were given when creating the partial the order in the partial is the same as the original function.

That is, in the following example the function (''message'') is partially applied using named arguments out of order, but the resulting partial function (''$p'') still has its parameters in the original order.  It may, of course, be called with named arguments itself if desired.

<code php>
function message(string $salutation, string $name, string $stmt): string {
    return "$salutation, $name. $stmt" . PHP_EOL;
}

$p = message(stmt: ?, name: ?, salutation: "Hello");
// Both of these have the same effect.
print $p('World', 'How are you.');
print $p(stmt: 'How are you.', name: 'World');
</code>

==== Evaluation order ====

One subtle difference between the existing short lambda syntax and the partial application syntax is that argument expressions are evaluated in advance.  That is:

<code php>
function getArg() {
  print __FUNCTION__ . PHP_EOL;
  return 'hi';
}

function speak(string $who, string $msg) {
  printf("%s: %s\n", $who, $msg);
}

$arrow = fn($who) => speak($who, getArg());
print "Mark\n";
$arrow('Larry');

/* Prints:
Mark
getArg
Larry: hi
*/

$partial = speak(?, getArg());
print "Mark\n";
$partial('Larry');

/* Prints:
getArg
Mark
Larry: hi
*/
</code>

The reason is that in the partial application case, the arguments are all evaluated first, and then the engine detects that some have placeholders.  In the short lambda case, the closure object is created first around an expression body that just so happens to include a function call that will happen later.

==== Constructors ====

Another caveat is around constructors.  While constructors are supported in partial application, the behavior of ''$this'' is significant.  Specifically, the ''Closure'' created by the partial application will already have a ''$this'' created, but the constructor has not yet been invoked.  That means calling the same partially applied constructor multiple times will not create a new object each time but rerun the constructor on the same object multiple times.

In some cases that behavior is acceptable, but only if the partially applied constructor can be guaranteed to be called once and only once.  If it needs to be called multiple times, the use of a named static constructor will avoid this issue.

<code php>
class Point {
  public function __construct(private int $x, private int $y) {}
  
  public static function create(...$args) {
    return new static(...$args);
  }
}

$data = [
  [1, 2],
  [4, 6],
  [3, 9],
  [7, 4],
];

// This works fine.
$points = array_map(Point::create(?, ?), $data);

// This would create and re-invoke the constructor on only a single object.
// Don't do this.
$points = array_map(new Point(?, ?), $data);
</code>

==== Use as an identifier ====

Although not the primary goal, this feature also provides a way to reference a function as a callable if needed in a given context.  Specifically, omitting all parameters during application would result in a callable with the same arity and signature as the original.  For example:

<PHP>
function by5(int $x) { return $x * 5; }

$arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

$result = array_map(by5(?), $arr);
</PHP>

That would make such functions still accessible to refactoring and static analysis tools, while avoiding any new syntax.

==== Optimizations ====

Although partials are implemented as a ''Closure'' instance, they do include an optimization in the case of repeated partial application to eliminate intermediate applications, and thus the resulting call stack when they are eventually called will include only one stack frame.

That is:

<code php>
function test(int $a, int $b, int $c, int $d, int $e) { ... }

$one = test(1, ?)(2, ?)(3, ?)(4, ?);

$two = test(1, 2, 3, 4, ?);

$three = fn(int $e) => test(1, 2, 3, 4, $e);


// These calls will all add only a single call frame,
// which will then call test(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
// From a semantic and performance perspective they are identical.
$one(5);
$two(5);
$three(5);
</code>

===== Reflection =====

Because a partially applied function is implemented using the existing ''Closure'' object, no additional reflection logic is necessary.  Once created, a partially applied function is identical to a manually created equivalent closure, and may be reflected upon the same way.

===== Comparison to other languages =====

Partial function application is a common pattern in computer science generally.  In practice, though, few mainstream languages have a dedicated syntax for it, relying instead on user-space implementations similar to "just write your own arrow function."

The languages that do have native support for it are generally highly functional languages such as Haskell or OCaml, in which all functions are automatically curried to single argument functions anyway.  In those languages, calling a function with fewer arguments than it specifies will automatically partially apply it with just those arguments, returning a function that expects the remaining arguments.  One limitation of that approach, however, is that functions may be partially applied only from left to right.  There is no way to "pre fill" just the right-most argument.

The notable exception is Racket (formerly known as Perl 6), which has an ''assuming'' method that prefills arguments left to right as well.

The net result is that the functionality described here would give PHP the most robust and powerful partial application syntax of any significant language on the market today.  Which is pretty damned cool, frankly.

===== Syntax choices =====

The ''?'' character was chosen for the placeholder largely because it was unambiguous and easy to implement.  Prior, similar RFCs (such as the original [[rfc:pipe-operator|Pipe Operator]] proposal from several years ago) used the ''$$'' sigil instead.  The RFC authors are open to considering other characters if they can be trivially swapped out, but would only support ''$$'' if it gets called ''T_BLING''.

Baring any strong consensus to the contrary, the plan is to stick with ''?''.

===== Related RFCs =====

Although this RFC is stand-alone, it naturally complements a few others under current discussion.

The [[rfc:pipe-operator-v2|Pipe Operator v2]] RFC proposes a new ''|>'' (pipe) operator that concatenates two callables, but was hampered by PHP's poor syntax for callables.  This RFC would largely resolve that issue and allow for the following syntax for pipes:

<code php>
$result = $var
|> step_one(?)
|> step_two(?, 'config')
|> $obj->stepThree('param', ?);
</code>

The original Pipes v1 proposal several years ago included similar functionality baked directly into the pipe operator.  By separating the two, it allows partial application to be used generally while still offering the same convenience for the pipe use case.
