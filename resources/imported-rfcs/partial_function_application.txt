===== Introduction =====
Partial function application is the process of fixing (or binding) only some of the arguments to a function call and leaving the remainder to be bound a later point.

===== Proposal =====
Support partial application via the argument placeholder ''?''. Any function or method call in which one or more of the arguments is an argument placeholder results in a ''Partial'' being created instead of invoking the function or method.

The resulting ''Partial'' will have a prototype that matches the function being applied, with the bound arguments removed:

<PHP>
function whole($one, $two) {
    /* ... */
}

$partial = whole(?, 2);
</PHP>

''$partial'' now has the prototype:

<PHP>
function($one) {
   /* ... */
}
</PHP>

When invoked, the ''Partial'' will call the bound function with the bound arguments at their bound positions, with the arguments to the partial being filled into the remaining spaces in-order:


<PHP>
function whole($one, $two) { /* ... */ }

// equivalent to calling whole(1, 2, 3)
$result = whole(?, 2)(1, 3); 
</PHP>

==== Types ====

Type declarations are retained, as are parameter names (e.g. for reflection.)

<PHP>
function f(int $x, int $y): int {}

$partial = f(?, 42);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$partial = function(int $x): int {
    return f($x, 42);
};
</PHP>


==== Variables/References ====

Variable arguments are ''use''d, and done so by reference if specified in the called function definition.

<PHP>
function f($value, &$ref) {}
 
$array = ['arg' => 0];

$f = f(?, $array['arg']);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP> 
$ref = &$array['arg'];
$f = function($value) use (&$ref) {
    return f($value, $ref);
};
</PHP>


==== Optional Parameters ====

Optional parameters remain optional, inheriting defaults.

<PHP>
function f($a = 0, $b = 1) {}

$f = f(?, 2);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$f = function($a = 0) {
    return f($a, 2);
};
</PHP>


==== func_num_args et al. ====

When a Partial invokes ''func_num_args'', it shall behave as if the function was invoked directly, such that:

<PHP>
function f($a = 0, $b = 0, $c = 3, $d = 4) {
    echo func_num_args() . PHP_EOL;
    
    var_dump(
        $a, 
        $b, 
        $c, 
        $d);
}

f(1, 2);

$f = f(?);

$f(1, 2);
</PHP>

Would output:

<PHP>
2
int(1)
int(2)
int(3)
int(4)
2
int(1)
int(2)
int(3)
int(4)
</PHP>

==== Methods ====

The same logic applies to any callable, including an already partially applied function and to methods.  For example:

<code php>
class Action {
    public function volume(int $x, int $y, int $z): int {
        return $x * $y * $z;
    }

    static public function vol(int $x, int $y, int $z): int {
        return $x * $y * $z;
    }
}

$p1 = Action::vol(3, 5, ?);
print $p1(9); // Prints 135

$a = new Action();
$p2 = $a->volume(3, 5, ?);
print $p2(9); // Prints 135
</code>

==== Extra Arguments ====

You can pass as many additional arguments as you like when calling a function in PHP, beyond what's specified in the signature. When you pass extra arguments to the closure, or during partial application, they are passed along to the wrapped function.

<PHP>
function f($a, $b) {
    print_r(func_get_args());
}

$f = f(?, 2);
</PHP>

is actually akin to:

<PHP>
$f = function($a, ...$extraArgs) {
    return f($a, 2, ...$extraArgs);
};
</PHP>

(Though without unnecessary packing/unpacking, or ''$extraArgs'' appearing in reflection.)

So calling: ''$f(1, 3, 4)'' results in:

<PHP>
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2
    [2] => 3
    [3] => 4
)
</PHP>


==== Trailing Placeholders ====

At least one argument placeholder is necessary to indicate partial application; additional argument placeholders may be present but are unnecessary. This eases partial application of functions with long lists of optional parameters.

<PHP>
function f($m, $n, $o, $x = 0, $y = 0, $z = 0) {}

$f = f(1, ?);
</PHP>

The above snippet is roughly (minding the ''func_num_args'' section above) equivalent to:

<PHP>
$f = function($n, $o, $x = 0, $y = 0, $z = 0) {
    return f(1, $n, $o, $x, $y, $z);
};
</PHP>

As a side effect, that means that a callable of any arity can be partially applied without any binding with a single ''?''.  That is:

<code php>
class Foo {
  public function bar($a, $b, $c, $d, $e, $f, $g, $h): string { ... }
}

$f = new Foo();
$p = $f->bar(?);

// $p is now a partially applied function with the same 8 arguments
// as Foo::bar.  Effectively there is no difference between now calling 
// $p(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and $foo->bar(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
</code>

That is especially useful when trying to use a method as a callable.

==== Extra Trailing Placeholders ====

Additional placeholders beyond a function's signature do not cause an error and have no additional impact, though effectively allow you to apply all arguments to a function to be called later.

<PHP>
$n = 1000000;

$log10ofn = log10($n, ?);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$log10ofn = function() use ($n) {
    return log10($n);
}
</PHP>


==== Variadic Functions ====

Variadic functions retain their signatures. Placeholders in a variadic position remain optional (there are no defaults, places not filled are simply not included in what's sent to the underlying function.) Fixed and placeholder arguments can be interleaved together.

<PHP>
function f(...$args) {
    print_r($args);
}

$f = f(?, 2, ?, 4, ?, 6);
$f(1, 3);
</PHP>

Would output:

<PHP>
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2
    [2] => 3
    [3] => 4
    [4] => 6
)
</PHP>

==== Named arguments ====

Named arguments may be used when creating a partial, or when calling it later.  The parameter names inherit to the partialed function.  However, regardless of the order the arguments were given when creating the partial the order in the partial is the same as the original function.

That is, in the following example the function (''message'') is partially applied using named arguments out of order, but the resulting partial function (''$p'') still has its parameters in the original order.  It may, of course, be called with named arguments itself if desired.

<code php>
function message(string $salutation, string $name, string $stmt): string {
    return "$salutation, $name. $stmt" . PHP_EOL;
}

$p = message(stmt: ?, name: ?, salutation: "Hello");
// Both of these have the same effect.
print $p('World', 'How are you.');
print $p(stmt: 'How are you.', name: 'World');
</code>

==== Use as an identifier ===

Although not the primary goal, this feature would also provide a way to reference a function as a callable if needed in a given context.  Specifically, omitting all parameters during application would result in a callable with the same arity as the original.  For example:

<PHP>
function by5(int $x) { return $x * 5; }

$arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

$result = array_map(by5(?), $arr);
</PHP>

That would make such functions still accessible to refactoring and static analysis tools, while avoiding any new syntax.

===== Reflection =====

This RFC introduces a new reflection class, ''ReflectionPartial'', which inherits from ''ReflectionFunctionAbstract''.  It accepts only a Partial as its single parameter, but then functions identically to any other ''ReflectionFunctionAbstract''.

Attempting to construct a ''ReflectionFunction'' with a ''Partial'' will result in an exception, and advise the programmer to use the correct class ''ReflectionPartial''.

===== Syntax choices =====

The ''?'' character was chosen for the placeholder largely because it was unambiguous and easy to implement.  Prior, similar RFCs (such as the original [[rfc:pipe-operator|Pipe Operator]] proposal from several years ago) used the ''$$'' sigil instead.  The RFC authors are open to considering other characters if they can be trivially swapped out, but would only support ''$$'' if it gets called ''T_BLING''.

Baring any strong consensus to the contrary, the plan is to stick with ''?''.

===== Related RFCs =====

Although this RFC is stand-alone, it naturally complements a few others under current discussion.

The [[rfc:pipe-operator-v2|Pipe Operator v2]] RFC proposes a new ''|>'' (pipe) operator that concatenates two callables, but was hampered by PHP's poor syntax for callables.  This RFC would largely resolve that issue and allow for the following syntax for pipes:

<code php>
$result = $var
|> step_one(?)
|> step_two(?, 'config')
|> $obj->stepThree('param', ?);
</code>

The original Pipes v1 proposal several years ago included similar functionality baked directly into the pipe operator.  By separating the two, it allows partial application to be used generally while still offering the same convenience for the pipe use case.
