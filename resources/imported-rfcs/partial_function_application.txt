===== Introduction =====
Partial function application is the process of binding only some of the arguments to a function call and leaving the remainder to be bound a later point. In PHP this would be done by a closure.

===== Proposal =====
Support partial function application via the argument placeholder ''?''. Any function or method call in which one or more of the arguments is an argument placeholder instead results in a closure being returned which wraps the called function, fixing the given (non-placeholder) arguments.

Type declarations, parameter names, reference parameters, optional defaults, variadics are all taken on by the closure from the function definition. All arguments given to a closure, including those beyond what are specified in the signature, get passed along to the underlying function.

The basic idea is to use a partial function call to stamp out a copy of the function, sans parameters where fixed arguments have already been given.

==== Types ====

Type declarations are retained, as are parameter names (e.g. for reflection.)

<PHP>
function f(int $x, int $y): int {}

$partial = f(?, 42);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$partial = function(int $x): int {
    return f($x, 42);
};
</PHP>


==== Variables/References ====

Variable arguments are ''use''d, and done so by reference if specified in the called function definition.

<PHP>
function f($value, &$ref) {}
 
$array = ['arg' => 0];

$f = f(?, $array['arg']);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP> 
$ref = &$array['arg'];
$f = function($value) use (&$ref) {
    return f($value, $ref);
};
</PHP>


==== Optional Parameters ====

Optional parameters remain optional, inheriting defaults.

<PHP>
function f($a = 0, $b = 1) {}

$f = f(?, 2);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$f = function($a = 0) {
    return f($a, 2);
};
</PHP>


==== func_num_args et al. ====

In order to keep ''func_num_args'' and friends happy, the arguments passed through will only be those up to and including the right-most actually given - whether at call time or during partial application. In other words, trailing optional parameters in the closure will not have their resolved defaults sent to the underlying function.

<PHP>
function f($a = 0, $b = 0, $c = 0, $d = 0) {
    echo func_num_args();
}

$f = f(?, 1, ?, ?);
$f(0, 2); // prints 3
$f(); // prints 2
</PHP>


==== Extra Arguments ====

You can pass as many additional arguments as you like when calling a function in PHP, beyond what's specified in the signature. When you pass extra arguments to the closure, or during partial application, they are passed along to the wrapped function.

<PHP>
function f($a, $b) {
    print_r(func_get_args());
}

$f = f(?, 2);
</PHP>

is actually akin to:

<PHP>
$f = function($a, ...$extraArgs) {
    return f($a, 2, ...$extraArgs);
};
</PHP>

(Though without unnecessary packing/unpacking, or ''$extraArgs'' appearing in reflection.)

So calling: ''$f(1, 3, 4)'' results in:

<PHP>
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2
    [2] => 3
    [3] => 4
)
</PHP>


==== Trailing Placeholders ====

Continuing on that, it is not required to include placeholders for trailing arguments, though at least one placeholder somewhere is necessary to indicate partial application. This is primarily to ease partial application of functions with long lists of optional parameters.

<PHP>
function f($m, $n, $o, $x = 0, $y = 0, $z = 0) {}

$f = f(1, ?);
</PHP>

is roughly (minding the ''func_num_args'' section above) equivalent to

<PHP>
$f = function($n, $o, $x = 0, $y = 0, $z = 0) {
    return f(1, $n, $o, $x, $y, $z);
};
</PHP>


==== Extra Trailing Placeholders ====

Additional placeholders beyond a function's signature do not cause an error and have no additional impact, though effectively allow you to apply all arguments to a function to be called later.

<PHP>
$n = 1000000;

$log10ofn = log10($n, ?);
</PHP>

is equivalent to

<PHP>
$log10ofn = function() use ($n) {
    return log10($n);
}
</PHP>


==== Variadic Functions ====

Variadic functions retain their signatures. Placeholders in a variadic position remain optional in the closure (there are no defaults, places not filled are simply not included in what's sent to the underlying function.) Fixed and placeholder arguments can be interleaved together.

<PHP>
function f(...$args) {
    print_r($args);
}

$f = f(?, 2, ?, 4, ?, 6);
$f(1, 3);
</PHP>

Would output:

<PHP>
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2
    [2] => 3
    [3] => 4
    [4] => 6
)
</PHP>

==== Named arguments ====

Named arguments may be used when creating a partial, or when calling it later.  The parameter names inherit to the partialed function.  However, regardless of the order the arguments were given when creating the partial the order in the partial is the same as the original function.

That is, in the following example the function (''message'') is partially applied using named arguments out of order, but the resulting partial function (''$p'') still has its parameters in the original order.  It may, of course, be called with named arguments itself if desired.

<code php>
function message(string $salutation, string $name, string $stmt): string {
    return "$salutation, $name. $stmt" . PHP_EOL;
}

$p = message(stmt: ?, name: ?, salutation: "Hello");
// Both of these have the same effect.
print $p('World', 'How are you.');
print $p(stmt: 'How are you.', name: 'World');
</code>

==== Use as an identifier ===

Although not the primary goal, this feature would also provide a way to reference a function as a callable if needed in a given context.  Specifically, a function that partials all of its parameters would result in a closure that is functionally identical to the original function.  For example:

<PHP>
function by5(int $x) { return $x * 5; }

$arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

$result = array_map(by5(?), $arr);
</PHP>

That would make such functions still accessible to refactoring and static analysis tools, while avoiding any new syntax.

===== Reflection =====

At the implementation level, a partialed callable is represented by an internal class, ''Partial'', that is similar to ''Closure''.  It also contains a, ''__invoke'' method that mirrors the reduced-scope signature.

Because ''Partial'' is distinct from ''Closure'', this RFC introduces a new reflection class, ''ReflectionPartial'', which inherits from ''ReflectionFunctionAbstract''.  It accepts only a partially applied function as its single parameter, but then functions identically to any other ''ReflectionFunctionAbstract'' child (such as ''ReflectionFunction'').

Additionally, a partial can be wrapped to a closure using ''Closure::fromCallable($partial)'', which can then be reflected using ''ReflectionFunction''.  This is a common way to normalize different callables into a single code path for reflection purposes, and works with partialed functions just as well as any other callable.

===== Syntax choices =====

The ''?'' character was chosen for the placeholder largely because it was unambiguous and easy to implement.  Prior, similar RFCs (such as the original [[rfc:pipe-operator|Pipe Operator]] proposal from several years ago) used the ''$$'' sigil instead.  The RFC authors are open to considering other characters if they can be trivially swapped out, but would only support ''$$'' if it gets called ''T_BLING''.

Baring any strong consensus to the contrary, the plan is to stick with ''?''.

===== Related RFCs =====

Although this RFC is stand-alone, it naturally complements a few others under current discussion.

The [[rfc:pipe-operator-v2|Pipe Operator v2]] RFC proposes a new ''|>'' (pipe) operator that concatenates two callables, but was hampered by PHP's poor syntax for callables.  This RFC would largely resolve that issue and allow for the following syntax for pipes:

<code php>
$result = $var
|> step_one(?)
|> step_two(?, 'config')
|> $obj->stepThree('param', ?);
</code>

The original Pipes v1 proposal several years ago included similar functionality baked directly into the pipe operator.  By separating the two, it allows partial application to be used generally while still offering the same convenience for the pipe use case.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
