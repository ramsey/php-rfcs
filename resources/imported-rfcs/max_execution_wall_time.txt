====== PHP RFC: Wall-Clock Time Based Execution Timeout ======

  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/6504

===== Introduction =====

On most platforms, PHP currently measures timeouts based on CPU time, rather than wall-clock time, so neither ''sleep()'', nor network or system calls count towards the limit of the ''max_execution_time'' ini setting. This behavior is not only surprising, but it can have serious consequences for distributed systems with high traffic, where finishing a request in a timely manner is essential for avoiding cascading failures.

Even if each individual network/system calls have their own timeouts, execution time can still horribly go out of control when there are hundreds or even thousands of such calls during the same request. This risk also applies to CLI scripts which can possibly execute millions of database queries or API requests.

To make things even worse, none of the most popular web servers offer a convenient solution. I.e. when using PHP-FPM as process manager, the ''request_terminate_timeout'' pool-level config option is available for stopping execution after a certain amount of time at latest. This can help, but it still falls short when there is a wide variety of acceptable timeout settings for the individual scripts. So in the end, one would have to maintain different pools for slow and fast scripts... Clearly, this can quickly become a burden. Not to mention the fact that ''RSHUTDOWN'' is not invoked in case of a PHP-FPM timeout, so any extensions that do monitoring are rendered useless.

Another solution for the problem could be using something like:

<PHP>
if (time() - $startTime > $timeout) {
    die("Timeout exceeded");
}
</PHP>

But let's just leave this idea aside...

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes to add a ''max_execution_wall_time'' ini setting. If a script runs longer than the value of ''max_execution_wall_time'', measured in seconds according to wall-clock (or real) time, a fatal error is raised. By default, the value of the ini setting is ''0'', which means that the allowed script duration is unlimited.

A limitation of the implementation is that the timeout takes into effect on a best-effort basis, meaning that the fatal error is triggered only after the call exceeding the time limit is finished. This is in line with the current timeout behavior, and the RFC considers this as an acceptable limitation.

Furthermore, there is a question in case of platforms which already measure ''max_execution_time'' based on wall-clock time. The most notable of such systems is definitely Windows, but IBM PASE and Cygwin are also affected, since they both only support real-time timers. The position of this RFC is that ''max_execution_wall_time'' should act as an "alias" of ''max_execution_time'' on these platforms, so any changes to the settings in question would affect the same timer.

Adding a ''set_time_limit()'' counterpart is out of scope of the current RFC.

===== Alternatives =====

HHVM solved the same problem by introducing the ''TimeoutsUseWallTime'' ini setting (https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/9a9b42e3610cdf242f16ddb8936ce34adfa0be9e) in order to offer a way to change the meaning of ''max_execution_time'', while still (partially) remaining compatible with PHP. This made sense for a sister language, but in case of PHP itself, it seems to be an unnecessary complication which could result in weird issues.

It would also be possible to directly change the behavior of ''max_execution_time'' to measure wall-clock time on all platforms. This approach is rejected by the current RFC mainly due to its vast BC break, and the fact that CPU-time based execution timeouts are useful as a sanity check of the code itself (e.g. for making sure there are no infinite loops).

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None.

===== Vote =====

Add the max_execution_wall_time ini setting?

The vote requires 2/3 majority to be accepted.
