====== PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 8.2 ======
  * Date: 2021-07-20
  * Author: Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionalities in PHP 8.2 and remove them in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * Call scope dependent behavior of internal methods

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.2 and removal in PHP 9.0.

==== Call scope dependent behavior of internal methods ====

A few internal methods return different values based on the scope they were called from:

  * XMLReader::open()
  * XMLReader::XML()
  * DOMElement::setAttribute()
  * DOMDocument::load()
  * DOMDocument::loadHTML()
  * DOMDocument::loadHTMLFile()
  * DOMDocument::loadXML()

These methods should be allowed to be called either statically, or from the object scope, and their behavior shouldn't depend on the scope.
