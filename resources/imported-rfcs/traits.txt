This RFC will discuss at first the motivation for Traits describing the rationals
and presenting a short real world use case. The main part will describe the
concept of Traits in detail using the syntax for Traits implemented in a patch
which is part of this proposal. In the end, the URL of the patch and 
additional resources about Traits are given.

===== Introduction =====

//Traits// is a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such
as PHP. A Trait is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance
by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent
classes living in different class hierarchies.
The semantics of the combination of Traits and classes is defined in a way,
which reduces complexity and avoids the typical problems associated with multiple
inheritance and Mixins.

They are recognized for their potential in supporting better composition
and reuse, hence their integration in newer versions of languages 
such as Perl 6, Squeak, Scala, Slate and Fortress.
Traits have also been ported to Java and C#.

==== Why do we need Traits? ====

Code reuse is one of the main goals that object-oriented languages try to achieve
with inheritance. Unfortunately, single inheritance often forces the developer
to take a decision in favor for either code reuse *or* conceptual clean class
hierarchies. To achieve code reuse, methods have either to be duplicated or
to be moved near the root of the class hierarchy, but this hampers
understandability and maintainability of code.

To circumvent this problems multiple inheritance and Mixins have been invented.
But both of them are complex and hard to understand. PHP5
has been explicitly designed with the clean and successful model of Java in
mind: single inheritance, but multiple interfaces. This decision has been taken
to avoid the known problems of for example C++.
Traits have been invented to avoid those problems, too. They enable designer to build
conceptually clean class hierarchies without the need to consider code reuse or
complexity problems, but focusing on the real problem domain and maintainability
instead.

===== Traits: A Mechanism for Fine-grained Reuse =====

A Trait is a unit of reuse much like a class, but only intended to group
functionality in a fine-grained and consistent way. It is not possible to
instantiate a Trait on its own. It is an addition to traditional inheritance
and enables horizontal composition of behavior.

The following code illustrates the current implementation of an extended
version of the PHP reflection API which provides detailed access to doc comment
blocks.

ReflectionMethod and ReflectionFunction are classes from the reflection API and
have to be extended with exactly the same code. In some situations it
would be possible to add a common base class, but in this case it is
impossible, because the extended classes are not under our control, i.e., they
are implemented in third party code or even in C, like it is the case here.

<code php>
 <?php
 class ezcReflectionMethod extends ReflectionMethod {
   /* ... */
   function getReturnType() { /*1*/ }
   function getReturnDescription() { /*2*/ }
   /* ... */
 }

 class ezcReflectionFunction extends ReflectionFunction {
   /* ... */
   function getReturnType() { /*1*/ }
   function getReturnDescription() { /*2*/ }
   /* ... */
 }
 ?>
</code>

With Traits it is possible to refactor this redundant code out.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait ezcReflectionReturnInfo {
   function getReturnType() { /*1*/ }
   function getReturnDescription() { /*2*/ }
 }

 class ezcReflectionMethod extends ReflectionMethod {
   use ezcReflectionReturnInfo;
   /* ... */
 }

 class ezcReflectionFunction extends ReflectionFunction {
   use ezcReflectionReturnInfo;
   /* ... */
 }
 ?> 
</code>

This is just a small example of what Traits are useful for.
The next sections will discuss on more advanced techniques and describe how the
current implementation of Traits for PHP works.

==== The Flattening Property ====

As already mentioned, multiple inheritance and Mixins are complex mechanisms.
Traits are an alternative which have been designed to impose no
additional semantics on classes. Traits are only entities of the literal code
written in your source files. There is no notion about Traits at runtime.
They are used to group methods and reuse code and are totally flattened 
into the classes composed from them. It is almost like a language supported and
failsafe copy'n'paste mechanism to build classes.

=== Precedence Order ===

Flattening is achieved by applying some simple rules on the composition
mechanism. Instead of implementing a fancy and awkward algorithm to solve
problems, the entire control about the composition is left in the hand of the
developer and fits nicely into the known inheritance model of PHP.
The following examples illustrate the semantics of Traits and their relation
to methods defined in classes.

<code php>
 <?php
 class Base {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello ';
   }
 }
 
 trait SayWorld {
   public function sayHello() {
     parent::sayHello();
     echo 'World!';
   }
 }

 class MyHelloWorld extends Base {
   use SayWorld;
 }

 $o = new MyHelloWorld();
 $o->sayHello(); // echos Hello World!
 ?>
</code>

As shown in the above code, an inherited method from a base class is overridden
by the method inserted into ''MyHelloWorld'' from the ''SayWorld'' Trait.
The behavior is the same for methods defined in the ''MyHelloWorld'' class.
The precedence order is that methods from the current class override Trait methods,
which in return override methods from the base class.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait HelloWorld {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello World!';
   }
 }

 class TheWorldIsNotEnough {
   use HelloWorld;
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello Universe!';
   }
 }

 $o = new TheWorldIsNotEnough();
 $o->sayHello(); // echos Hello Universe!
 ?>
</code>

=== Multiple Traits Usage ===

To keep things simple in the beginning, there has only one Trait being used at
a time, but obviously a class could use multiple Traits at the same time.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait Hello {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello ';
   }
 }

 trait World {
   public function sayWorld() {
     echo ' World';
   }
 }
 
 class MyHelloWorld {
   use Hello, World;
   public function sayExclamationMark() {
     echo '!';
   }
 }
 
 $o = new MyHelloWorld();
 $o->sayHello();
 $o->sayWorld();
 $o->sayExclamationMark();
 // Results eventually in: Hello World!
</code>

=== Conflict Resolution ===

But now a problem will occur, if different Traits provide methods with the
same name.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait A {
   public function smallTalk() {
     echo 'a';
   }
   public function bigTalk() {
     echo 'A';
   }
 }

 trait B {
   public function smallTalk() {
     echo 'b';
   }
   public function bigTalk() {
     echo 'B';
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

Both classes have to be used in a class named ''Talker''. Multiple inheritance
and Mixins define an algorithm to resolve this conflict. Traits don't. Conflicts
are not solved implicitly by any kind of precedence. Instead, to avoid implicit
complexity, the developer has full control over class composition.

<code php>
 <?php
 class Talker {
   use A, B;
 }
 ?>
</code>
 
In case of the above definition of ''Talker'', PHP will show a notice that there
have been conflicts and name the methods ''smallTalk()'' and ''bigTalk()'' 
as the reason of this conflict. Therefore, neither of the given implementations
will be available in the class.

Instead, the developer can exactly define which methods are used and how the
conflict is resolved.

<code php>
 <?php
 class Talker {
   use A, B {
     B::smallTalk instead A::smallTalk,
     A::bigTalk instead B::bigTalk
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

This definition will result in the exclusion of ''smallTalk()'' from the Trait A
and ''bigTalk()'' from Trait B. Therefore, the resulting class Talker would 
echo ''"b"'' for ''smallTalk()'' and ''"A"'' for ''bigTalk().''
But simple exclusion of methods is not the best choice for all situations.

<code php>
 <?php
 class Talker {
   use A, B {
     B::smallTalk instead A::smallTalk, 
     A::bigTalk instead B::bigTalk,
     A::bigTalk as talk
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

Beside the exclusion an alias operation is available, too. This alias
operation, notated like ''originalMethodName as additionalMethodName''
for arrays even has a similar semantics like the array notation.
The definition ''A::bigTalk as talk'' lets the new name ''talk'' refer
to the method body of ''bigTalk'' of the Trait B. The resulting ''Talker'' 
class will consist of following three methods:

* ''bigTalk() { echo 'A'; }''
* ''smallTalk() { echo 'b'; }''
* ''talk() { echo 'B'; }''

Since the alias operation adds a new name to an existing method body, the
''bigTalk'' method still has to be excluded. Otherwise, PHP would print
a notice that two methods from Traits have a conflict and are excluded.
Aliasing is not renaming and references in methods to a given method name
aren't changed either. On the first look this may sound strange, but it
provides the opportunity to build Traits and even hierarchies of Traits which
fit together very well.

=== Traits Composed from Traits ===

Not explicitly mentioned jet, but implied by the flattening property is the
composition of Traits from Traits.
Since Traits are fully flattened away at compile time it is possible to use
Traits to compose Traits without any additional impact on the semantics.
The following code illustrates this:
<code php>
 <?php
 trait Hello {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello ';
   }
 }

 trait World {
   public function sayWorld() {
     echo 'World!';
   }
 }

 trait HelloWorld {
   use Hello, World;
 }

 class MyHelloWorld {
   use HelloWorld;
 }

 $o = new MyHelloWorld();
 $o->sayHello();
 $o->sayWorld();
 // Results eventually in: Hello World!
 ?>
</code>

Traits itself can take part in arbitrary compositions, but Traits are not part
of the inheritance tree i.e., it is not possible to inherit from a Trait to
avoid confusion and misuse of Traits.

=== Express Requirements by Abstract Methods ===

Since Traits do not contain any state/properties, there is a need to describe
the requirements a Trait will rely on. In PHP it would be possible to utilize
the dynamic language features, but it is a common practice to give this
requirements explicitly.
This is possible with abstract methods like it is used for abstract classes.

<code php> 
 <?php
 trait Hello {
   public function sayHelloWorld() {
     echo 'Hello'.$this->getWorld();
   }
   abstract public function getWorld();
 }

 class MyHelloWorld {
   private $world;
   use Hello;
   public function getWorld() {
     return $this->world;
   }
   public function setWorld($val) {
     $this->world = $val;
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>
 
The usage of abstract methods allows to state not always obvious relation ships
and requirements explicitly. It is favored over the implicit usage of the
dynamic method resolution and property creation in the context of complex
projects for the sake of readability.

==== Traits Semantics Summarized ====

  - Traits do not add runtime semantics, they only take part in the process of building a class.
  - Traits integrate into the precedence order of method overriding.
  - To avoid complexity, conflicts between Trait methods have to be solved explicitly. Otherwise a notice is generated and the conflicting methods are excluded.
  - Specific methods can be excluded from a composition to handle conflicts.
  - Aliases can be defined for methods to enable reuse of conflicting methods.
  - Traits can be composed from Traits.
  - Traits can state requirements explicitly by the use of abstract methods.

As a result of this semantics, at runtime, classes build using Traits are not distinguishable 
from classes not using Traits but traditional code duplication instead.
Semantics of ''parent'' and ''$this'' hasn't changed, too. Used in a Trait
method, they behave exactly the same as if the method has been defined in the
class directly.

==== Visibility ====

Visibility modifiers have not been discussed so far. Since Traits are meant as
units of reuse, modifiers should be changeable easily in the context of a
composed class. Therefore, the aliasing operation is able to change the
visibility modifier of a method, too.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait HelloWorld {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello World!';
   }
 }

 class MyClass1 {
   use HelloWorld { sayHello as protected }
 }

 class MyClass2 {
   use HelloWorld { doHelloWorld as private sayHello }
 }
 ?>
</code>

The final modifier is supported, too. The static modifier is not supported,
because it would change the methods semantics and references to ''$this''
would break.

===== Common Misconceptions =====

==== Aliasing vs. Renaming ====

The presented aliasing operation has not a semantic of renaming.
Instead it does only provide a new name to be able to invoke the original
method with this new name even if the original name was excluded.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait A {
   public function a() {
     echo 'a';
     $this->b();
   }
   public function b() {
     echo 'b';
   }
 }

 class Foo {
   use A {
     c => b
   }
 }

 $foo = new Foo();
 $foo->a();            //echos ab
 $foo->b();            //echos b
 $foo->c();            //echos b
 ?>
</code>

Since it is not renaming the original method b is still available and has not
been influenced at all.

Furthermore, aliasing implies that the method body of an aliased method is not
changed in any kind. From this it follows that a recursion available in the
original method wont result in a recursion in the alias method:
<code php>
 <?php
 trait A {
   public function foo() {
     echo 'a';
     $this->foo();
   }
 }

 class MyA {
   use A { foo as bar }
   public function foo() {
     echo 'b';
     $this->foo();
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>
The result to a call on ''bar()'' would echo ''abbbbb...'' theoretically as infinity
recursion on ''foo()'', but not on ''bar()'', since it is only executed once.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

This Request for Comments proposes a new language feature for PHP named Traits.
Traits are a nice approach to enhance the capabilities to design conceptual
consistent class hierarchies and avoid code duplication.

Patches:

  * against PHP_5_2: http://toolslave.net/snapshots/traits/traits.patch
  * against PHP_5_3: http://toolslave.net/snapshots/traits/traits-5.3.patch
  * Test Cases: http://toolslave.net/snapshots/traits/traits-tests.zip
  * SVN: https://instantsvc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/instantsvc/branches/php-extension/traits-php/ 

==== Alternative Syntax Proposals ====

This section collects proposals for alternative Traits syntaxes.

=== Alternative Keywords for use ===

The keyword use is already reserved for the new namespace feature.
Thus, alternative keywords has been proposed on the mailing list.
The general idea remains the same, Trait usage is defined in the class body
like this:

<code php>
 class Foo {        class Foo {
   exhibit Bar;        possess Bar;
 }                  }
</code>

Proposed keywords:
  * use (but already used for namespaces)
  * exhibit or exhibits (not basic vocabulary?)
  * possess or possesses (hard to write?)
  * attach
  * acquire
  * adopt
  * apply
  * has
  * consume
  * implement (almost the like ''implements'')
  * include (but also ambiguous)
  * inline
  * import
  * inject
  * trait 

=== Alternatives for the ''instead'' keyword ===

There has been the proposal of the keyword ''over'' instead of the ''instead''
keyword:

<code php>
 use A, B, C, D {
     B::smallTalk over A, C, D; // to be read like: use B::smallTalk
                                // instead the implementations form A, C, D
 }
</code>


=== Alternatives for the Aliasing Notation ===

Aliasing is often misunderstood as renaming.
May be some of the following notations will help:

<code php>
 [1] is keyword instead of the arrow 
 use Trait {
  bar is foo1;  //methodAlias is method
 }
</code>

Interpretation: ''is'' state something about ''bar'', there is nothing stated
about ''foo1''.

Alternative keyword for the same notation meaning:
  * as
  * alias
  * from

Or some explicit variations:

<code php>
 use Trait {
   alias bar as foo1;
   clone bar as foo1;
 }

 [3] with method as methodAlias
 use Trait {
   without foo3;
   with bar as foo1,
        boo as foo2;
 }
</code>

Think the proposal [3] reads very well, since, the keyword pair with/without
expresses the opposed semantics. The Trait is partially modified in this
composition by removing some thing (''foo3'') and adding something (''bar'',
''boo'').

==== Rejected Features ====

=== Interfaces Propagation ===

Another important feature of PHP is the support of interfaces. A often used
metaphor to describe Traits is *Traits are interfaces with implementation*.
Traits can be utilized to provide the implementation for a specific interface
and since an interface is a guarantee that some methods are available it fits
in the concept of Traits which provides those methods very well.

To underpin this relationship, it is possible to declare that a Trait
implements an interface like this:

<code php>
 <?php
 interface IHello {
   public function sayHello();
 }
 
 trait SayHello implements IHello {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello World!';
   }
 }

 class MyHelloWorld {
   use SayHello;
 }
 
 $o = new MyHelloWorld();
 var_dump($o instanceof IHello);  // bool(true)
</code>

If a Trait implements an interface, this definition is propagated to the class
using the Trait. Therefore, it is possible to provide implementations for an interface
and reuse them in different classes.

=== Traits Use Definition in the Class Header ===

Instead of declaring the Trait composition in the class body, it could be
defined in the class prologue like this:
 
<code php>
 <?php
 trait Hello {
   public function sayHello() {}
 }

 class MyHelloWorld extends BaseClass
   uses Hello (hello => sayHello, !sayHello) 
 {
   public function foo() {}
 }
 ?>
</code>

The drawback of this notation is the implied notation of Traits as some kind of
a type changing construct. Since they do not influence the type as their major
feature, this notion would be misleading. Furthermore, this notation seams to
have readability problems. Complex compositions are not as clearly arranged as
they are with the *In-Body* notation.
A patch implementing this notation is available at: http://toolslave.net/snapshots/traits/traits-head-syntax.patch

=== Alternative Expression of Exclusion (Exclusion is rejected at all) ===

Some people do not like the notation with the exclamation mark.
Possible alternative keywords for following notation style:
<code php>
 use Trait {          use Trait {
   not foo1, foo2;      without foo1, foo2;
 }                    }
</code>
Keywords:
  * !      (not readable?)
  * not
  * hide   (not exactly the meaning of exclusion)
  * ignore
  * without
  * unset
  * except (may be mistaken with exception stuff)


==== More about Traits ====

As already mentioned, Traits is not a totally new concept, but the semantics
used in this proposal has been fully defined at first in 2003. For scientific
information and papers about Traits http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Research/Traits/
is a good starting point. Since it isn't a purely academic concepts, there are
already languages supporting Traits out there. Squeak, Perl6, Scala, Slate,
Fortress and even for C#/Rotor implementation are available.

A detailed technical report has been published at 
http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Archive/Papers/Duca06bTOPLASTraits.pdf
It explains Traits and gives some formal proves about the soundness of Traits, too.

Last but not least, in this Phd thesis http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Archive/PhD/schaerli-phd.pdf
two case studies have been publish illustrating the benefits Traits are providing.
