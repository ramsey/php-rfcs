====== PHP RFC: Remove alternative PHP tags ======
  * Date: 2014-09-09
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Targeting: PHP 7
  * Patch: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/813

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes the removal of ASP tags (''<%'') and script tags ''<script language=php>'') as a means of entering or leaving PHP mode.

The following syntactical elements are removed:

  * ''<%'' opening tag
  * ''<%='' short opening tag
  * ''%>'' closing tag
  * ''(<script\s+language\s*=\s*(php|"php"|'php')\s*>)i'' opening tag
  * ''(</script>)i'' closing tag

The listed opening tags will no longer enter PHP mode and the listed closing tags will no longer leave PHP mode.

Additionally the ''asp_tags'' ini directive is removed.

===== Vote =====

As this is a language change a 2/3 majority is required.
