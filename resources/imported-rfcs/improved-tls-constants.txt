====== PHP RFC: Improved SSL / TLS constants ======
  * Version: 0.1.1
  * Date: 2017-05-15
  * Author: Niklas Keller, me@kelunik.com
  * Status: Voting

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes to change PHP's TLS constants to sane values. This change has been avoided by the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/improved-tls-defaults|previous RFC for PHP 5.6]] due to BC reasons. This RFCs favors better security instead of backwards compatibility with version intolerant and out of date servers.

===== Proposal =====
  * Make ''<nowiki>tls://</nowiki>'' default to TLSv1.0 + TLSv1.1 + TLSv1.2
  * Make ''<nowiki>ssl://</nowiki>'' an alias of ''<nowiki>tls://</nowiki>''
  * Make ''<nowiki>STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLS_*</nowiki>'' constants default to TLSv1.0 + TLSv1.1 + TLSv1.2 instead of TLSv1.0 only

''<nowiki>STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLS_*</nowiki>'' will be changed in the future when newer versions of TLS are available without going through the RFC process.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This might break connection attempts to TLS servers with only TLS 1.0 enabled and that are version intolerant at the same time. This also breaks ''<nowiki>ssl://</nowiki>'' wrapper connections if only SSL is supported by the remote host, but no TLS. While strongly discouraged, an explicit context option passing ''<nowiki>STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv2_* | STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv3_* | STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLS</nowiki>'' can be used to restore the old behavior.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
This change will be merged into 7.2 if accepted.

===== Future Scope =====
In the future ''<nowiki>STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv23_CLIENT</nowiki>'' should be deprecated and SSL support completely removed.

===== Voting =====
This is a simple 50%+1 vote with yes and no options. The voting started on 29th of May 2017 and will end on 5th of June 2017.
