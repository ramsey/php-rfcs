This RFC discusses two different approaches to reuse behavior independently
from the class hierarchy, i.e., in an horizontal manner. The main motivation 
of both approaches is to provide a broader opportunity to model classes and
class hierarchies with a clear conceptual background and optimal code reuse at
the same time. Furthermore, the main distinction to other approaches is the 
explicit handling of conflicts resulting from overlapping interfaces in complex
reuse scenarios. Both approaches would be valuable extensions to the PHP 
language, but both of them have their own benefits and drawbacks. 
Thus, this RFC is meant to provide a base for further discussion to be able
to decide, which variant is the most PHP-like reuse mechanism.

====== Why Do We Need Horizontal Reuse? ======

Code reuse is one of the main goals that object-oriented languages try to 
achieve with inheritance. Unfortunately, single inheritance often forces 
the developer to take a decision in favor for either code reuse //or// 
conceptual clean class hierarchies. To achieve code reuse, methods have 
either to be duplicated or to be moved near the root of the class hierarchy,
but this hampers understandability and maintainability of code.

To circumvent this problems multiple inheritance and Mixins have been invented.
But both of them are complex and hard to understand. PHP5 has been explicitly
designed with the clean and successful model of Java in mind: 
single inheritance, but multiple interfaces. This decision has been taken
to avoid the known problems of for example C++. The presented approaches have
been designed to avoid those problems and to enable designers to build 
conceptually clean class hierarchies without the need to consider code reuse
or complexity problems, but focusing on the real problem domain and 
maintainability instead.

===== Limitations to Reuse in Single Inheritance Languages =====

There are several issues with reuse in PHP. To achieve as much reuse as
possible you will probably move methods as high as possible in your inheritance
hierarchy. At this point, there is a trade-off between conceptual consistency
and reuse, because classes starts to have methods they do not need. So, when it
is decided that the conceptual consistency is more valuable because of
understandability of the class model, code duplication is caused or needs to be
worked around by e.g. delegation, which is not always as nice as method
implemented in the class tree.

Beside conceptual issues, there are problems with third-party code you can not
or might not want to modify. The following code illustrates the current 
implementation of an extended version of the PHP reflection API which provides
detailed access to doc comment blocks. ''ReflectionMethod'' and 
''ReflectionFunction'' are classes from the reflection API and have to be 
extended with exactly the same code. In this case it is impossible to change
the classes itself, because they are not under our control i.e. they are 
implemented in C as part of the language.

<code php>
 <?php
 class ezcReflectionMethod extends ReflectionMethod {
   /* ... */
   function getReturnType() { /*1*/ }
   function getReturnDescription() { /*2*/ }
   /* ... */
 }

 class ezcReflectionFunction extends ReflectionFunction {
   /* ... */
   function getReturnType() { /*1*/ }
   function getReturnDescription() { /*2*/ }
   /* ... */
 }
 ?>
</code>

Thus, eventually, we end up with much duplicated code in both classes extending
the original extension classes.
===== Which Opportunities Does PHP Have? =====

For the sake of distinction and discussion, the two approaches 
are named differently. The idea of //Traits// for PHP has been already proposed 
in a former [[rfc:Traits|RFC]]. In addition to that, this RFC introduces the notion 
of //Grafts// (the term is borrowed from [[http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/agriculture/plant/propagation/grafting.htm|agrarian cultivation]]).

A //Trait// is an unit of behavioral reuse. It is very lightweight, stateless and
allows for a very flexible composition of behavior into classes.
A //Graft// is a class composed into another class. It is very much like grafting is
done in the agriculture. It allows for a full-fledged reuse of classes inside
of other classes independent of the class hierarchy.
The following proposal will introduce both flavors of horizontal reuse and
compares them in the context of PHP.
====== Traits - Reuse of Behavior (committed to trunk) ======

//Traits// is a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such
as PHP. A Trait is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance
by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent
classes living in different class hierarchies.
The semantics of the combination of Traits and classes is defined in a way,
which reduces complexity and avoids the typical problems associated with 
multiple inheritance and Mixins.

They are recognized for their potential in supporting better composition
and reuse, hence their integration in languages such as Perl 6, Squeak, 
Scala, Self, Slate and Fortress. Traits have also been ported to Java and C#.
In the following, the concepts behind Traits will be adapted for PHP to propose
two different approaches which resemble the main ideas.

A Trait is similar to a class, but only intended to group functionality in a 
fine-grained and consistent way. It is not possible to instantiate a Trait on
its own. It is an addition to traditional inheritance and enables horizontal
composition of behavior.

In the introduction an example has been given illustrating reuse limitations
of single inheritance. With Traits it is possible to remove the duplicated code
without compromising conceptual consistency.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait ezcReflectionReturnInfo {
   function getReturnType() { /*1*/ }
   function getReturnDescription() { /*2*/ }
 }

 class ezcReflectionMethod extends ReflectionMethod {
   use ezcReflectionReturnInfo;
   /* ... */
 }

 class ezcReflectionFunction extends ReflectionFunction {
   use ezcReflectionReturnInfo;
   /* ... */
 }
 ?>
</code>

This is just a small example of what Traits are useful for.
The next sections will discuss more advanced techniques and describe how
Traits are used in PHP.

===== The Flattening Property =====

As already mentioned, multiple inheritance and Mixins are complex mechanisms.
Traits are an alternative which have been designed to impose no
additional semantics on classes. Traits are only entities of the literal code
written in your source files. There is no notion about Traits at runtime.
They are used to group methods and reuse code and are totally flattened 
into the classes composed from them. It is almost like a language supported and
failsafe copy'n'paste mechanism to build classes.

Even though, there is no runtime notion of Traits, since they are part of the
source code and thus, define the structure of the system, reflection about
Traits still is possible, but they do not influence the runtime behavior of the
system.

==== Precedence Order ====

Flattening is achieved by applying some simple rules on the composition
mechanism. Instead of implementing a fancy and awkward algorithm to solve
problems, the entire control about the composition is left in the hand of the
developer and fits nicely into the known inheritance model of PHP.
The following examples illustrate the semantics of Traits and their relation
to methods defined in classes.

<code php>
 <?php
 class Base {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello ';
   }
 }
 
 trait SayWorld {
   public function sayHello() {
     parent::sayHello();
     echo 'World!';
   }
 }

 class MyHelloWorld extends Base {
   use SayWorld;
 }

 $o = new MyHelloWorld();
 $o->sayHello(); // echos Hello World!
 ?>
</code>

As shown in the above code, an inherited method from a base class is overridden
by the method inserted into ''MyHelloWorld'' from the ''SayWorld'' Trait.
The behavior is the same for methods defined in the ''MyHelloWorld'' class.
The precedence order is that methods from the current class override Trait methods,
which in return override methods from the base class.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait HelloWorld {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello World!';
   }
 }

 class TheWorldIsNotEnough {
   use HelloWorld;
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello Universe!';
   }
 }

 $o = new TheWorldIsNotEnough();
 $o->sayHello(); // echos Hello Universe!
 ?>
</code>

==== Multiple Traits Usage ====

To keep things simple in the beginning, there has only one Trait being used at
a time, but obviously a class could use multiple Traits at the same time.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait Hello {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello ';
   }
 }

 trait World {
   public function sayWorld() {
     echo ' World';
   }
 }
 
 class MyHelloWorld {
   use Hello, World;
   public function sayExclamationMark() {
     echo '!';
   }
 }
 
 $o = new MyHelloWorld();
 $o->sayHello();
 $o->sayWorld();
 $o->sayExclamationMark();
 // Results eventually in: Hello World!
</code>
==== Conflict Resolution ====

Traits are already used in different programming languages and it has shown
that conflicts will occur, but they are the exception, not the rule. In most
systems under investigation, the mechanisms to resolve conflicts have been used
very infrequently, but also have proven to be a valuable mechanisms. Since it
increases the composition power of the developers.
One example for a typical conflict are different Traits providing methods with the
same name.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait A {
   public function smallTalk() {
     echo 'a';
   }
   public function bigTalk() {
     echo 'A';
   }
 }

 trait B {
   public function smallTalk() {
     echo 'b';
   }
   public function bigTalk() {
     echo 'B';
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

Both classes have to be used in a class named ''Talker''. Multiple inheritance
and Mixins define an algorithm to resolve this conflict. Traits don't. Conflicts
are not solved implicitly by any kind of precedence. Instead, to avoid implicit
complexity, the developer has full control over class composition.

<code php>
 <?php
 class Talker {
   use A, B;
 }
 ?>
</code>
 
In case of the above definition of ''Talker'', PHP will abort compilation with a fatal error since there
have been conflicts. It will name the methods ''smallTalk()'' and ''bigTalk()'' 
as the reason of this conflict. 
A fatal error is issued since the conflict indicates that an incompatible change was made to the code that potentially breaks the expected behavior.

To solve the conflict, the developer can exactly define which of the colliding methods has to be used.

<code php>
 <?php
 class Talker {
   use A, B {
     B::smallTalk insteadof A;
     A::bigTalk insteadof B;
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

This definition will result in leaving out ''smallTalk()'' from Trait A
and ''bigTalk()'' from Trait B. Therefore, the resulting class Talker would 
echo '''b''' for ''smallTalk()'' and '''A''' for ''bigTalk().''
But this simple form of exclusion of methods is not the best choice for all 
situations.

<code php>
 <?php
 class Talker {
   use A, B {
     B::smallTalk insteadof A; 
     A::bigTalk insteadof B;
     B::bigTalk as talk;
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>
 
Beside leaving out methods it is possible to introduce a new name for a method
from a Trait. This is done like ''originalMethodName as additionalMethodName''.
In the example above, it has to be read as ''use B::bigTalk as talk in class
Talker''. This does not imply any [[#renaming]], instead ''talk'' is introduced as
an additional name for this method. Thus, recursion inside of ''talk'' will
still call a method with the name bigTalk.
The resulting ''Talker'' class will consist of following three methods:

  * ''bigTalk() { echo 'A'; }''
  * ''smallTalk() { echo 'b'; }''
  * ''talk() { echo 'B'; }''

Since the new name is recognized as an additional method, the ''bigTalk'' 
method still has to be excluded. Otherwise, PHP would print
a warning that two methods from Traits have a conflict and are excluded.
The introduction of a new name is not [[#renaming]] and references in methods to a 
given method name aren't changed either. On the first look this may sound 
strange, but it provides the opportunity to build Traits and even hierarchies 
of Traits which fit together very well.

==== Traits Composed from Traits ====

Not explicitly mentioned yet, but implied by the flattening property is the
composition of Traits from Traits.
Since Traits are fully flattened away at compile time it is possible to use
Traits to compose Traits without any additional impact on the semantics.
The following code illustrates this:

<code php>
 <?php
 trait Hello {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello ';
   }
 }

 trait World {
   public function sayWorld() {
     echo 'World!';
   }
 }

 trait HelloWorld {
   use Hello, World;
 }

 class MyHelloWorld {
   use HelloWorld;
 }

 $o = new MyHelloWorld();
 $o->sayHello();
 $o->sayWorld();
 // Results eventually in: Hello World!
 ?>
</code>

Traits itself can take part in arbitrary compositions, but Traits are not part
of the inheritance tree i.e., it is not possible to inherit from a Trait to
avoid confusion and misuse of Traits.
==== Express Requirements by Abstract Methods ====

Since Traits do not contain any state/properties, there is a need to describe
the requirements a Trait will rely on. In PHP it would be possible to utilize
the dynamic language features, but it is a common practice to give this
requirements explicitly.
This is possible with abstract methods like it is used for abstract classes.

<code php> 
 <?php
 trait Hello {
   public function sayHelloWorld() {
     echo 'Hello'.$this->getWorld();
   }
   abstract public function getWorld();
 }

 class MyHelloWorld {
   private $world;
   use Hello;
   public function getWorld() {
     return $this->world;
   }
   public function setWorld($val) {
     $this->world = $val;
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

The usage of abstract methods allows to state not always obvious relation ships
and requirements explicitly. It is favored over the implicit usage of the
dynamic method resolution and property creation in the context of complex
projects for the sake of readability.


==== Static Variables ====

The flattening property implies that all methods are independent from each other at their usage point, even so, they might origin from the same method/trait.
Imagine you would like to implement a counter by using a static variable and use that at various places. Each of the counters should be independent.

<code php>
  <?php
    trait Counter {
      public function inc() {
        static $c = 0;
        $c = $c + 1;
        echo "$c\n";
      }
    }

    class C1 {
      use Counter;
    }

    class C2 {
      use Counter;
    }

    $o = new C1(); $o->inc(); // echo 1
    $p = new C2(); $p->inc(); // echo 1
  ?>
</code>

==== Static Methods ====

Following the idea that traits are almost like compiler assisted copy'n'paste, all the features presented so far also apply to static methods.
This is useful for instance to provide a reusable implementation for the singleton pattern:

<code php>
  <?php
    trait Singleton {
      public static function getInstance() { ... }
    }

    class MySingleton extends SomeUnrelatedSuperClass {
      use Singleton;
    }

    MySingleton::getInstance();
  ?>
</code>

===== Traits Semantics Summarized =====

  - Traits do not add runtime semantics, they only take part in the process of building a class.
  - Traits integrate into the precedence order of method overriding.
  - To avoid complexity, conflicts between Trait methods have to be solved explicitly. Otherwise a warning is generated and the conflicting methods are excluded.
  - In combinations with conflicts, developers have to chose explicitly which method has to be used, methods not chosen will be excluded from the composition.
  - Aliases can be defined for methods to enable reuse of conflicting methods.
  - Traits can be composed from Traits.
  - Traits can make requirements explicit by abstract methods.

As a result of this semantics, at runtime, classes build using Traits are not distinguishable 
from classes not using Traits but traditional code duplication instead.
Semantics of ''parent'' and ''$this'' hasn't changed, too. Used in a Trait
method, they behave exactly the same as if the method has been defined in the
class directly.

===== Visibility =====

Visibility modifiers have not been discussed so far. Since Traits are meant as
units of reuse, modifiers should be changeable easily in the context of a
composed class. Therefore, the aliasing operation is able to change the
visibility modifier of a method, too.

<code php>
 <?php
 trait HelloWorld {
   public function sayHello() {
     echo 'Hello World!';
   }
 }

 class MyClass1 {
   use HelloWorld { sayHello as protected }
 }

 class MyClass2 {
   use HelloWorld { doHelloWorld as private sayHello }
 }
 ?>
</code>

The final modifier is supported, too. The static modifier can not be used in this context. That means, a normal method can not be converted to a static method, because it would change the methods semantics and references to ''$this'' would break.


===== Handling of Properties/State =====

Traits do not provide any provisioning for handling state.
They are meant to provide a light-weight mechanism for flexible code reuse,
with the main goal being to avoid code duplication.
Moreover, traits should not be confused with typical use cases of classes.
When a strong coherence/coupling between methods and state is required,
and invariants have to be maintained on the state, this is a good 
indication that a class is the right abstraction to implement that problem 
with.

However, every behavior needs state to operate on, otherwise it could be just
a static functional helper method.
Thus, trait code will either need to use accessors, which is favorite way to
go since it provides full traits semantics, or they use properties, which
is possible but rather a convenience feature.

Since state is a complex problem, and the knowledge about compatibility of 
state form different traits is only present in a concrete composition, proper
state handling would need language features which are currently considered
beyond the scope of what is necessary for PHP. (See [[http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Berg07eStatefulTraits.pdf|Bergel et al]])

Thus, the goal for a consistent language design is to raise awareness of the
problem, promote the use of accessors, and break early in case the changes to
a trait is potentially problematic for a class using it. This results in the
following rules:

  - Properties are considered incompatible if they differ in their definition. This means, they differ in the applied modifiers (static, public, protected, private) or their initial value.
  - Incompatible properties result in a fatal error.
  - In all other cases, i.e., when the definitions are identical, an E_STRICT notice is shown to raise awareness about the potentially problematic, and discouraged use of properties.
  - For those checks, all properties are treated equal. Properties from the base class and the composing class have to be compatible with properties from traits as well as the properties between all traits have to be compatible.
  - Non-coliding properties, and properties which are not considered incompatible behave exactly the same as if they would have been defined in the composing class.

This property handling was implemented in [[http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=306476|SVN revision 306476]] and examples are given in the test cases.


===== Reflection =====

Status: The Reflection API is not completely adapted for traits yet.

The following functions are added to match the existing class- or interface-specific functions. 
  * trait_exists()  -- returns true for traits, false for all kind of classes and interfaces
  * get_declared_traits()  -- returns the defined traits, no classes or interfaces

====== Grafts - Class Composition (not implemented) ======

A //Graft// is a class composed into another class to reuse it avoiding
inheritance and without an explicit need for delegation. The most important 
difference to a Trait is the possibility to define state in addition to 
behavior inside the reused entity. Furthermore, the grafting approach is not 
about reuse methods in a manner focused on flexibility, but instead it is 
about reusing small encapsulated units of behavior and state to build classes 
from them. Thus, it could be viewed as a form of private multiple inheritance 
which avoids conflicts by keeping everything private to the Graft per default.

Grafts can be used in an similar way as Traits can be used. Thus, the example
from the introduction can be optimized with Grafts as well.

<code php>
 <?php
 class ezcReflectionReturnInfo {
   function getReturnType() { /*1*/ }
   function getReturnDescription() { /*2*/ }
 }

 class ezcReflectionMethod extends ReflectionMethod {
   use ezcReflectionReturnInfo {
     public getReturnType();
     public getReturnDescription();
   }
   /* ... */
 }

 class ezcReflectionFunction extends ReflectionFunction {
   use ezcReflectionReturnInfo {
     public getReturnType();
     public getReturnDescription();
   }
   /* ... */
 }
 ?> 
</code>

Since, everything is local to the Graft per default, the methods need to be
enumerated to be accessible in the class and its interface.

===== Grafting Classes =====

A Graft is a class itself and can be instantiated at will. Compared to a normal
class, there are no restrictions, it can use state and it can use
everything else allowed for a class i.e. it is a normal class.

The following class is an example for a simple counter:

<code php>
 <?php
 class Counter {
   private $cnt = 0;
   public function inc() {
     $this->cnt++;
   }
   public function reset() {
     $this->cnt = -1;
     $this->inc();
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

The ''reset()'' is defined a bit strange, because it uses the ''inc()''
function to set the counter value to zero. This is to illustrate the semantics
of a Graft inside another class. This counter can be used totally on its own.
Thus, ''$c = new Counter(); $c->inc();'' is valid code and will work as
expected.

Another example class might be a database helper class to initialize and reset
a connection:

<code php>
 <?php
 class DB {
   private $db;
   public function connect() {
     $this->db = new FooDB('param');
   }
   public function reset() {
     $this->db->flush();
     unset($this->db);
   }
   public function doFoo(){echo 'foo';}
 }
</code>

Nothing special in this class. The ''connect()'' function uses some Foo
database abstraction layer to initialize the connection and ''reset()'' will
issue a flush operation on the database object and unsets it afterwards.

==== Compose A Class From Classes ====

Inheritance is one of the most misunderstood relationships in object-oriented
programming. It is often abused to achieve code reuse, but originally it was
meant to describe the relationship between classes from a conceptual view.
Thus, apples and oranges might be characterized as subclasses of a class fruit
and could be subclassed themselves into classes for specific variants.

In a web application where you for instance would like to build a page with a
language allowing multiple inheritance you could start to model a ''MyPage''
class as subclass of ''Counter'' and ''DB'', since you like to derive the
behavior of both of them. But from the conceptual view it is not clear why
MyPage is a counter or a database. Both relationships are implied by the ''instanceof''
operation. Technically, this might have its values, but still it sounds strange.

Thus, in single inheritance languages, //delegation// i.e. //forwarding// is used
instead. The ''MyPage'' class provides the necessary interfaces for ''Counter''
and ''DB'' but instead of implementing it itself, it forwards the method call
to another object:

<code php>
 <?php
 class MyPage {
   private $cnt;
   private $db;
   /* ... */
   public function inc() { $cnt->inc(); }
   public connect() { $db->connect(); }
   /* ... */
 }
 ?>
</code>

This approach is very common and has its merits. Unfortunately, it requires
explicit code to implement forwarding and object injection or creation which is
tedious. In complex cases this might even cause a broken encapsulation, since
it might be necessary to forward data to another object which should be private
to the calling object.

Grafts are designed to overcome this situation and provide similar
opportunities for reuse like Traits do. The following code demonstrates how
Grafts can be used to compose the ''MyPage'' class from the two other classes:

<code php>
 <?php
 class MyPage {
   use Counter {
     public incCnt() from inc();
     public resetCnt() from reset();
   }
   use DB {
     public connect();
     public reset();
   }
   public function inc() {
     /* next page */
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

The example above shows ''MyPage'' using classes ''Counter'' and ''DB'', to
graft their functionality into it. Since, all methods from a grafted class are
hidden from the grafting class by default, the methods to be used in the
grafting class or from another class need to be named explicitly.
With this approach, conflicts are avoided upfront. In case of methods with the
same name in a graft and another graft or the class itself, it is possible to
make a method available by another name. In the given example the method
''reset()'' is made available by the name ''resetCnt()''. This alias does not
influence the inner working of the ''Counter'' class in anyway. Thus, recursion
inside of ''Counter::reset()'' would still work like expected and the call to
''incCnt()'' results in an invocation of ''Counter::inc()''. This would be not
true for Traits as explained earlier.

With this attributes of Grafts in mind, the following example shows the results
of the execution of methods in the context of ''MyPage'':

<code php>
 <?php
 $page = new MyPage();
 $page->connect();
 $page->incCnt();   // Counter::$cnt == 1
 $page->resetCnt(); // Counter::$cnt == 0
 $page->inc();      // goto next page
 $page->doFoo();    // FATAL ERROR
 ?>
</code>

The call to ''connect()'' is forwarded as expected to ''DB::connect()'',
''incCnt()'' results in a call to ''Counter::inc()'' as already mentioned, the
call to ''inc()'' will invoke the ''MyPage::inc()'' method defined directly in
the class. The call to ''doFoo()'' results in an error, since the method
defined in ''DB'' has not been made available in ''MyPage'' explicitly.

==== Interaction of Grafts with Grafted Classes ====

In class-based languages like PHP, the notion of abstract classes was 
introduced, to be able to define a unit of reuse in a partial manner and to 
be able to refine it in a more concrete context.

This notion can be used combined with grafting as well. Thus, abstract methods
can be fulfilled by a graft or from the grafting class.

The following example shows how a class can be used by grafting to fulfill a
required abstract method:

<code php>
 <?php
 abstract class Base {
   abstract public function foo();
 }
 
 class MyGraft {
   public function foo() { echo 'foo'; }
 }
 
 class MyGraftedClass extends Base {
   use MyGraft {
     public foo();
   }
 }

 $o = new MyGraftedClass();
 $o->foo(); // echos 'foo'
 ?>
</code>

In addition, this notion can also be utilized to provide methods to a graft,
which states a requirement by an abstract class. This case is shown in the 
code below:

<code php>
 <?php
 abstract class MyGraft {
   abstract public function foo();
   public function bar() {
     $this->foo();
   }
 }

 class MyGraftedClass {
   public function foo() { echo 'foo'; }
   use MyGraft {
     public bar();
   }
 }

 $o = new MyGraftedClass();
 $o->bar(); // echos 'foo'
 ?>
</code>

For properties and methods not explicitly required, it is not possible to 
provide something similar, since this would lead to ambiguity. The reasons 
are described in the discussion section.

==== Grafting of the Same Class Multiple Times ====

Since, different grafts are separated from each other, it is possible to graft
the same class multiple times into one class::

<code php>
 <?php
 class MyGraft {
   public function foo() { echo 'foo'; }
 }
 class MyGraftedClass {
   use MyGraft {
     public foo();
   } 
   use MyGraft {
     public bar() from foo();
   }
 }
 $o = new MyGraftedClass();
 $o->foo(); // echos 'foo'
 $o->bar(); // echos 'foo'
 ?>
</code>

This might not be useful for all classes, but could be used to graft data
structures like lists or maps into a class which are used for multiple
purposes.

==== Restrictions and Initialization of Grafts ====

Actually an instantiated graft is nothing else but an object. Since grafts are
full-fledged classes themselves, they could use typical constructors to
initialize resources or prepare their inner state for further usage. In the
current form of this proposal, the notion of initializing grafts is not
supported, thus, only classes with a standard constructor without arguments can
be used to be grafted into another class.

Another restriction is that classes can not graft themselves and more
generally, grafting is not allowed to cause recursion in any way. Since, it is
not meant to be evaluated lazily, it would case an infinite recursion which
needs to be prevented. 

==== Implementation Idea ====

Eventually, the implementation seems only to be feasible by maintaining the 
notion of separate objects for classes grafted into another class. Thus, for
each graft in a class, a normal object is instantiated. This approach will ease
the implementation and will reduce modification in method lookup and the Zend
Engine in general. 

Methods propagated to the grafting class will be generated like usual methods
implemented by hand. Thus, they will contain the opcodes to forward the method
call to the grafted object. In reverse, it would be the same for methods 
introduced by abstract methods satisfied by the grafting class. Those methods 
will call the method provided by the grafting class. 

The most visible problem in this approach will be the handling of object
identity of grafted objects. Imagine the following code:

<code php>
 <?php
 class MyGraft {
   public function returnThis() {
     return $this;
   }
 }
 class MyGraftedClass {
   use MyGraft {
     public returnThis();
   }
 }
 $o = new MyGraftedClass();
 var_dump($o->returnThis());
 ?>
</code>

The result returned should be definitely equal to ''$o'' i.e. ''$o === $o->returnThis()''. 
The reason for this requirement is to preserve
encapsulation and hide implementation details from all clients of
''MyGraftedClass''. To achieve this property some kind of context dependent
treatment of the ''$this'' lookup has to be implemented or some kind of data flow
analysis will have to be done. Neither of them seem to be easy to achieve with
respect to the fact, that a grafted class cold hold its own ''$this'' value in
some property, for whatever reason.

The other way around would be to open up the notion of grafts and add
mechanisms to inject instances of grafts into a class while object
construction. By the way, this would allow more fancy dependency injection
and gives a reason to think about grafts not only as implementation
details, but an interface related i.e. //client visible// characteristic.
But, this notion is currently not part of this proposal.

===== Grafts Semantics Summarized =====

  - A Graft is a normal class composed into another class.
  - The encapsulation of grafts is preserved completely.
  - All methods available as part of the grafting class have to be enumerated explicitly and can have a different name than the method in the grafted class, without breaking inner coherence.
  - Grafts can interact with grafting classes via abstract methods.
  - Methods introduced by a Graft can be used to fulfill abstract methods.
  - Classes can be grafted into a class multiple times.
  - Classes to be used as Grafts are not allowed to use constructors with arguments.

====== Traits vs. Grafts ======

This section gives a basic overview about the differences of both concepts and
discusses benefits and drawbacks.

//Traits// are entities of behavioral reuse. Thus, they provide a lightweight way
to compose methods into classes. They are highly composable themselves, not
hindered by a strong notion of encapsulation and abandon state for the sake of
simplicity.

//Grafts// are classes composed into other classes to achieve reuse of
full-fledged classes. It introduces a stronger notion of composition of classes
than typical delegation/forwarding does for OOP languages.

**Traits**
  * stateless
  * can "break"
  * notation is DRY
  * flexible composition of behavior
  * flattenable, no runtime impact

**Grafts**
  * complete classes
  * robust encapsulation
  * some overhead in notation
  * convenient composition of classes
  * language supported delegation/forwarding

This proposal does only suggest Traits without state to avoid the introduction
of any notion of Traits at runtime. The key idea of Traits is that they provide
method implementations which are flattened into a class. Thus, all state is
defined in the class and Traits method have to rely on PHPs dynamic nature or
have to use abstract method definitions to require getters and setters.
Since Grafts are full-fledged classes, they have state and handle it as
expected for distinct objects.

One point of criticism from the community on the notion of Traits is that the
methods provided by Traits are not reliable connected. This leads to missing
features like recursion for methods introduced by aliases. From the perspective
of composition, this is desired, since it provides additional opportunities for
combination of behavior. Traits are not meant to provide encapsulation on the
level of classes, but flexibility.
Grafts do avoid this problem by its nature of being classes, but this comes for
the cost of flexibility. Grafts can not combined with another. They are
completely separated entities which only can be combined by abstract methods.

The notion of Traits avoids any impact on the runtime. For Grafts this is not
feasible. They need to maintain strong encapsulation which is achieved in an
consistent way only by preserving the notion of internal objects. Thus, there
is overhead in memory consumption for the objects and runtime cost for
forwarding method calls compared to Traits.

Another point where Grafts might be improved (see syntax proposals) is the
syntax for using a class. To avoid conflicts methods are private to a graft per
default and thus, need to be enumerated explicitly. Compared to Traits this is
not DRY and implies a little overhead in code, but obviously less overhead than
typical forwarding cases. With respect to Traits, research has shown that
conflicts occur only rarely and explicit handling of it is much less overhead
and brings more power than trying to solve it implicitly.
====== Discussions ======

For the original Traits proposal a lot discussion has already taken place. The [[rfc:traits|RFC]]
summarizes the most important ones. Eventually, it resulted in an additional
[[rfc:nonbreakabletraits|RFC]] proposing non-breakable Traits, which led finally to this proposal.
The first thread on was started on the [[php-internals@120336491008719|mailing list]] back in February 2008.

===== Renaming =====
One of the main issues of the Traits proposal has always been the fact, that aliasing does not mean renaming. The reason for this is the dynamic nature of PHP.
The fact that it is possible to use meta-programming features everywhere in the code means that names as present in the source-code have to be equal to the names at run time.

Consider the following example:

<code php>
<?php
class TestClass {
    function foo() { echo "func: foo\n"; }
    function bar() { echo "func: bar\n"; }
    
    function test() {
        $funcName = "foo";
        $this->$funcName();

        $funcName = "bar";
        $this->$funcName();
    }
}

$o = new TestClass;
$o->test();
</code>

Renaming would imply that it would not be possible to use this or similar techniques with Traits.
At least, it would not be stable. It would be possible to hack around it, but these hacks would be brittle, and lead to additional maintenance work.


===== Requiring Composing Class to Implement Interface =====

Traits are able to express required methods by using abstract method declarations.
An abstract method can be satisfied in varios ways, for instance by implementing it
in the composing class or by bringing it in from another Trait.

However, for traits that require complex interfaces to be satisfied, this approach is tedious
and fragile, since it requires the developer to state all used methods explicitly.

Another solution is that a Trait expresses a requirement for the composing class to implement
a certain interface. This is not entirely identical to using abstract methods, however.
First, it imposes a requirement on interface level and thus will have the same fragility
with respect to interface changes as all other clients of an interface.
On the other hand, it avoids duplications of abstract method definitions and makes
the interface the main entity of responsibility as for normal client-interface uses
in current code.

<code php>
<?php
// IteratorUser works with $this using the Iterator interface
trait IteratorUser require Iterator {
    function foo() {
        $next = $this->next();
        ...
    }
}

// composed into a class that needs to implement the interface
class Example implements Iterator {
  use IteratorUser;
}

</code>

Note: brought up in the discussion of http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=129188077704898

===== Grafts =====

PHP as a dynamic language would give the opportunity to work with this
grafts functionality more flexible, even without abstract method definitions, 
but this would be very unintuitive since the graft does not know it is using 
methods or properties from the grafted class. On the one hand this would even
break the notion of encapsulation and on the other hand, it would cause trouble 
at least for properties because here it might be that the different order of method
execution results in unintended different results. Imagine something simple like::

<code php>
 <?php
 class MyGraft {
   public function get() { return $this->value; }
   public function set($value) { $this->value = $value; }
 }
 ?>
</code>

Grafted into a class it would depend on the behavior of the grafted class,
whether there is a property named value and thus the encapsulation is broken.
Thus, it would be ambiguous to allow a forwarding from within a grafted class
to its grafting class for non-defined properties and methods.

===== Alternative Syntax Proposals =====

Different keywords and alternative syntaxes for traits have been already
discussed on the mailing list and are documented more detailed in the
original [[rfc:traits|RFC]].

Some important proposals and new additional proposals are listed below for
traits as well as grafts.

==== Traits ====

Assignment instead of ''insteadof'':

Keywords are a rare resource in any language. Thus, new keywords should be
introduced carefully. To avoid the ''insteadof'' keyword, a notion of assignment
was proposed. On the first look, it seams even to avoid an impression of
renaming:

<code php>
 <?php
 class Talker {
   use A, B, C, D {
     smallTalk = A::smallTalk; // this says that if 
                               // B, C or D implement smallTalk,
                               // it is ignored
     talk = A::bigTalk;
   }
 }
 ?>
</code>

==== Grafts ====

Grafts use wildcard: 

The proposed Grafts syntax is not DRY and all methods names to be made
available need to be enumerated. To avoid this enumeration, a syntax with a
wildcard was proposed:

<code php>
 <?php
 class MyGraftingClass {
   use MyGraftClass *;
 }
 ?>
</code>

==== Scala Synthax and practical example ====

This is inpired from [[http://www.scala-lang.org/node/117]].

=== Use case #1 (user comments on a given object) ===

A trait would prevent duplicating this code (~roughly similar) in 9 classes (existing PHP framework).

<code php>
trait User_Comments 
{
     function addComment($c)
     {
           $db = App::getDb();   
           $db->Execute("INSERT INTO user_comments (type, type_id, user_id, text)VALUES ($c->type, $c->type_id, $c->uid, $c->text)");
     }

     function getComments($filter)
     {
           return array();
     }

     function removeComment($id)
     {
           $db = App::getDb();   
           $db->Execute("DELETE FROM user_comments ... ");
     }
}
</code>

Using the trait:

<code php>
class App_Email with User_Comments {}

class App_Document with User_Comments  {

     function removeComment($id)
     {
           $db = App::getDb();   
           $db->Execute("DELETE FROM user_comments ... ");

           $db->Execute("UPDATE app_documents SET comments_count = ... ");
     }
}
// PHP notice : 'User_Comments::removeComment() definition skipped in App_Document'

$doc = new App_Document;

echo is_a($doc, 'App_Document');     // true
echo is_a($doc, 'User_Comments');    // false
echo is_with($doc, 'User_Comments'); // true
</code>

We deal with conflicting class definitions by simply ignoring them.

<code php>
trait Conflict_Comments 
{
     function removeComment($id)
     {
           return false;
     }
}

class App_Document_Conflict with User_Comments, Conflict_Comments  {

     function removeComment($id)
     {
           $db = App::getDb();   
           $db->Execute("DELETE FROM user_comments ... ");

           $db->Execute("UPDATE app_documents SET comments_count = ... ");
     }
}
// PHP notice : 'User_Comments::removeComment() definition skipped in App_Document_Conflict'
// PHP notice : 'Conflict_Comments::removeComment() definition skipped in App_Document_Conflict'

$doc = new App_Document_Conflict;

echo is_a($doc, 'App_Document_Conflict');// true
echo is_with($doc, 'User_Comments');     // true
echo is_with($doc, 'Conflict_Comments'); // true
</code>

=== Use case #2 (bitmask flags) ===

A trait would prevent duplicating this code (~roughly similar) in 21 classes (existing PHP framework).

<code php>
trait Bitmask_Flags {

	private $_flags;

	private function _hasFlag($flag, $yesNo)
	{
		if(is_null($yesNo))
			return (($this->_flags & $flag) == $flag);
		
		if($yesNo)
			$this->_flags |= $flag;
		else
			$this->_flags &= ~$flag;
			
		if((int)$flag === 0)
			$this->_flags = 0;
	}
}
</code>

Using the trait:

<code php>
class Sports_Game with Bitmask_Flags {

	function isOvertime($yesNo = NULL)
	{
		return $this->_hasFlag(self::FLAG_OVERTIME, $yesNo);
	}

	function isShootout($yesNo = NULL)
	{
		return $this->_hasFlag(self::FLAG_SHOOTOUT, $yesNo);
	}
        //...
}

class User with Bitmask_Flags {

	function isAdmin($yesNo = NULL)
	{
		return $this->_hasFlag(self::FLAG_ADMIN, $yesNo);
	}

	function isActive($yesNo = NULL)
	{
		return $this->_hasFlag(self::FLAG_ACTIVE, $yesNo);
	}
        //...
}
</code>


====== Links and Literature ======

As already mentioned, Traits is not a totally new concept, but the semantics
used in this proposal has been fully defined at first in 2003. For scientific
information and papers about Traits http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Research/Traits/
is a good starting point. Since it isn't a purely academic concepts, there are
already languages supporting Traits out there. Squeak, Perl6, Scala, Slate,
Fortress and even for C#/Rotor implementation are available.

A detailed technical report has been published at 
http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Archive/Papers/Duca06bTOPLASTraits.pdf
It explains Traits and gives some formal proves about the soundness of Traits, too.

Last but not least, in this PhD thesis http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Archive/PhD/schaerli-phd.pdf
two case studies have been publish illustrating the benefits Traits are providing.
