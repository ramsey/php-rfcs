====== PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 7.1 ======
  * Date: 2015-12-28
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

This is a draft RFC for multiple deprecations targeting PHP 7.1. The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 7.1 and remove it no later than in PHP 8.0.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * ''%%__autoload%%''
  * ''$php_errormsg''
  * ''create_function()''
  * ''rand()'', ''srand()'' and ''getrandmax()''
  * ''mbstring.func_overload''

===== Proposal =====

==== __autoload ====

The magic [[http://php.net/__autoload|__autoload]] function has been superseded by [[http://php.net/spl_autoload_register|spl_autoload_register]] in PHP 5.1 and its use discouraged in the documentation. One primary advantage of ''spl_autoload_register()'' is the ability to provide multiple chained autoloaders, thus easing library interoperability. Both mechanism are mutually exclusive, i.e. code using ''%%__autoload()%%'' cannot interoperate with code using ''spl_autoload_register()''. As the latter is much more commonly used and also employed by Composer, the ''%%__autoload()%%'' mechanism has only very limited applicability nowadays.

Proposed action: A deprecation notice is thrown when a global function with name ''%%__autoload()%%'' is encountered during compilation.

==== $php_errormsg ====

The [[http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.phperrormsg.php|$php_errormsg]] variable is created in the local scope whenever a non-fatal error is thrown, if the ''track_errors'' ini setting is enabled (disabled by default) and the error has not been consumed by an error handler.

Apart from being ini-dependent language behavior, this behavior is highly magic and the [[http://php.net/error_get_last|error_get_last]] function provides a cleaner way of retrieving the last error. Since PHP 7 additionally the [[http://php.net/manual/en/function.error-clear-last.php|error_clear_last]] function is available, thus covering the last possible use-cases for ''$php_errormsg'' without magic scope manipulation.

Proposed action: A deprecation notice is thrown if the ''track_errors'' ini setting is enabled.

==== create_function() ====

[[http://php.net/create_function|create_function()]] is a thin wrapper around the ''eval()'' language construct, allowing the creation of a function with a generated function name and the argument list and body code provided as string arguments. Before the introduction of closures in PHP 5.3 it provided a way to create something akin to lambda functions.

Due to the nature of its operation ''create_function()'', apart from being a potential source of security issues, has very bad performance and memory usage characteristics and the use of real closures is in every way preferable.

Proposed action: Mark the function as deprecated, thus issuing a deprecation notice on every call.

==== rand(), srand() and getrandmax() ====

The [[http://php.net/rand|rand()]] function exposes the libc random number generator to PHP. The output and quality of this random number generator is system dependent. Notably, on Windows rand() can only generate at most 32767 unique values for any value range (if the value range includes more than 32767 numbers, some numbers will never be returned). Furthermore Windows uses a very low quality linear congruential generator with bad statistical properties (it's so bad you can see the non-uniformity with the naked eye).

As alternative, PHP provides [[http://php.net/mt_rand|mt_rand()]], which is based on the 32-bit MT19937 algorithm. While not ideal (it generates at most 2147483647 unique values, even on 64-bit platforms), mt_rand() is strictly superior to rand() and does not have a platform dependence. It should always be preferred over rand().

The corresponding seeding function is [[http://php.net/srand|srand()]] and [[http://php.net/getrandmax|getrandmax()]] returns the maximum number returned by the underlying generator. If rand() is deprecated, these should be deprecated as well.

Proposed action: Mark all three functions as deprecated, thus issuing a deprecation notice on every call.

Alternative action: Alias rand() etc. to the corresponding mt_*() functions. We may want to do some other changes do our non-crypto PRNG functionality at the same time, see http://markmail.org/message/gxjpvmvguhpni5zu.

==== mbstring.func_overload ====

The [[http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.overload.php|mbstring.func_overload]] ini setting allows replacing a certain subset of string functions with analogs from the mbstring extension. For example ''strlen()'' will no longer return the length of a string in bytes, instead it will return the length in code points according to the currently selected internal encoding.

This implies that code using mbstring.func_overload is incompatible with practically all other code, which is written under the assumption that basic string operations work normally. Some libraries outright forbid func_overload (e.g. Symfony), others will break in more subtle ways. Code that wants to support func_overload needs to conditionally switch between ordinary string functions and mbstring functions with 8bit encoding (however only cryptography libraries normally bother to do this).

In a previous [[http://markmail.org/message/vckycqqppwxhp2gk|discussion on this topic]] the consensus was to deprecate this functionality. The original author of the extension also recommended this action.

Proposed action: Throw a deprecation notice if ''mbstring.func_overload'' is set to a non-zero value.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 7.1 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 8.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Each of the bullet points above will get a separate vote. All votes will require a 2/3 supermajority, independently of whether they are language changes or not.

===== Patches and Tests =====

The patches for these deprecations are for the most part trivial, as such they will be provided once the RFC is accepted (or portions of it).

===== Rejected deprecations =====

The following section lists features that have been suggested for deprecation, but have not been included in this RFC for the outlined reasons.

==== $http_response_header ====

The [[http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.httpresponseheader.php|$http_response_header]] variable is created in the local scope if an HTTP request is performed, for example through ''file_get_contents()''. It contains an array of HTTP response headers.

The motivations for removing this functionality are similar to those of ''$php_errormsg'', so it would seem reasonable to deprecate them at the same time. However, unlike ''$php_errormsg'' there exist no //simple// alternatives to ''$http_response_header''. The [[http://php.net/get_headers|get_headers]] function returns only the headers, but not the response body. Getting both requires, to my knowledge, a combination of ''fopen()'', ''stream_get_contents()'' and reading the ''wrapper_data'' from ''stream_get_meta_data()''.

===== Changelog =====
