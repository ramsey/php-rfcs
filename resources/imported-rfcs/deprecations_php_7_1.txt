====== PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 7.1 ======
  * Date: 2015-12-28
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

This is a draft RFC for multiple deprecations targeting PHP 7.1. The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 7.1 and remove it no later than in PHP 8.0.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * ''%%__autoload%%''
  * ''$php_errormsg''
  * ''create_function()''

===== Proposal =====

==== __autoload ====

The magic [[http://php.net/__autoload|__autoload]] function has been superseded by [[http://php.net/spl_autoload_register|spl_autoload_register]] in PHP 5.1 and its use discouraged in the documentation. One primary advantage of ''spl_autoload_register'' is the ability to provide multiple chained autoloaders, thus easing library interoperability. Both mechanism are mutually exclusive, i.e. code using ''%%__autoload()%%'' cannot interoperate with code using ''spl_autoload_register()''. As the latter is much more commonly used and also employed by Composer, the ''__autoload'' mechanism has only very limited applicability nowadays.

Proposed action: A deprecation notice if thrown when a global function with name ''__autoload'' is encountered during compilation.

==== $php_errormsg ====

The [[http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.phperrormsg.php|$php_errormsg]] variable is created in the local scope whenever a non-fatal error is thrown, if the ''track_errors'' ini setting is enabled (disabled by default) and the error has not been consumed by an error handler.

Apart from being ini-dependent language behavior, this behavior is highly magic and the [[http://php.net/error_get_last|error_get_last]] function provides a cleaner way of retrieving the last error. Since PHP 7 additionally the [[http://php.net/manual/en/function.error-clear-last.php|error_clear_last]] function is available, thus covering the last possible use-cases for ''$php_errormsg'' without magic scope manipulation.

Proposed action: A deprecation notice is thrown if the ''track_errors'' ini setting is enabled.

==== create_function() ====

The [[http://php.net/create_function|create_function()]] is a thin wrapper around the ''eval()'' language construct, allowing the creation of a function with a generated function name and the argument list and body code provided as string arguments. Before the introduction of closures in PHP 5.3 it provided a way to create something akin to lambda functions.

Due to the nature of its operation ''create_function()'', apart from being a potential source of security issues, has very bad performance and memory usage characteristics and the use of real closures is in every way preferable.

Proposed action: Mark the function as deprecated, thus issuing a deprecation notice on every call.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 7.1 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 8.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.
