====== Request for comments: Streamline Phar API ======
===== Abstract =====
This proposal aims to streamline the Phar API to make it more usable and intuitive. 
===== Concrete change proposals =====


==== Phar ====
=== Modifying Phar archive content ===
== Related methods ==
  * offsetSet()
  * offsetGet()
  * offsetExists()
  * offsetUnset()
== Proposal ==
In the current API, every path is represented by a single array index. This is counter intuitive, as a multi-dimensional structure (the archive) is represented as a single dimensional array accessible object. The idea is to change that object to represent every path element (e.g. "bar" in "foo/bar/baz") as a single index. This would be accomplished by letting the DirectoryIterator implement ArrayAccess.
== Code ==
<code php>
$phar = new Phar('test.phar');
$phar['path']['to']['file'] = 'test'; // Set content 'test' in path/to/file
</code>

=== Adding isWritable() method ===
== Proposal ==
Add an isWritable() method to determine whether an archive can be written or not. Not being able to write an archive either means it is disabled in the php.ini (see Phar::canWrite()) or that PHP can't write to the requested location of the phar archive.
== Code ==
<code php>
$phar = new Phar('test.phar');
if ($phar->isWritable()) {
    $phar['path']['to']['file'] = "test";
}
</code>

=== Adding createDirectory() ===
== Proposal ==
Add the method Phar->createDirectory() to explicitly create a new directory. createDirectory() will return another Phar object and takes a dirname (string) as an argument.
== Code ==
<code php>
$phar = new Phar('test.phar');
$dir = $phar->createDirectory('foo');
$dir['file'] = 'content'; // Set the file 'foo/file' to 'content'
</code>

==== SplFileInfo ====
PharFileInfo is derived from SplFileInfo. Every change in SplFileInfo will be visible in PharFileInfo.
=== setContent/getContent ===
== Proposal ==
Add two simple methods to write/retrieve content.
== Code ==
<code php>
$file = new SplFileInfo("file");
$file->setContent('foo');
echo $file->getContent(); // returns 'foo'
</code>
=== get*Time() methods ===
== Related methods ==
  * getMTime()
  * getATime()
  * getCTime()
== Proposal ==
Rename the methods to make them more independent from their origin, the UNIX naming scheme and therefore better to understand for a people with non-UNIX backgrounds. Leave the original method names but trigger deprecation warnings and remove them in PHP 6.
  * getMTime() => getModificationTime()
  * getATime() => getAccessTime()
  * getCTime() => getCreateTime()

==== PharFileInfo ====
=== setCompressed*() methods ===
== Related methods ==
   * setCompressedBZIP2()
   * setCompressedGZ()
   * setUncompressed()
== Proposal ==
Unify this methods to a single method compress(). The compress method will take one argument indicating the compression algorithm. The compression algorithm is represented as a Phar class constant. The setUncompressed() method should be renamed to uncompress().
== Code ==
<code php>
$file->compress(Phar::BZ2); // Compress with bzip2
$file->compress(Phar::GZ);  // Compress with gzip
$file->uncompress();
</code>
=== isCompressed*() methods ===
== Related methods ==
  * isCompressedBZIP2()
  * isCompressedGZ()
  * isCompressed()
== Proposal ==
Unify this methods to one PharFileInfo::isCompressed(). The new isCompressed() would take an optional argument with the compression algorithm. The compression algorithm is represented as a Phar class constant.
== Code ==
<code php>
$file->isCompressed(); // Is the file compressed at all?
$file->isCompressed(Phar::GZ); // Is the file gzip compressed?
$file->isCompressed(Phar::BZ2); // Is the file bzip compressed?
</code>
