===== Introduction =====

**If you're short on time: [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/improved-tls-defaults#tldr_definitive_progress|TL;DR Definitive Progress]]**

PHP stream encryption uses several potentially insecure default settings. This RFC explores the
problematic nature of the current settings and recommends actionable improvements. The proposed
changes increase the security of encrypted stream transmissions at the same time they eliminate the
need for user knowledge of the underlying protocols.

This proposal complements the previously accepted [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tls-peer-verification|TLS Peer Verification RFC]]
which is insufficient as a standalone measure to address potential TLS pitfalls. The backward
compatibility costs of the recommendations found here are congruent with those found in the previous
RFC. Note that BC breakage is //not// seen at the userland API level (where all changes are compatible
with existing code). Instead, disruptions can occur in the form of transfer failures which were
previously allowed to proceed in an insecure manner. As all streams are inherently vulnerable to
failure at any time, userland code //should// have existing error handling mechanisms in place to
address any failures arising from the proposed security enhancements.

In short, this proposal exists because peer verification is only half of the secure stream
encryption equation. The verification of peer certificates affords little protection if the
implementation subsequently engages in other insecure practices. This proposal addresses the
remaining side of the encrypted transfer equation to transparently maximize data security.

  * [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/improved-tls-defaults#tls_compression|Disable TLS compression by default]]

  * [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/improved-tls-defaults#stream_wrapper_creep|Deprecate superfluous stream wrappers and allow protocol flags]]

===== DEFAULT Ciphers =====

Currently all encrypted stream transports use the openssl ''DEFAULT'' cipher list unless munually
specified by the user via a ''"ciphers"'' SSL context option. This behavior exposes unwitting users
to the possibility that very weak ciphers will be negotiated for SSL/TLS sessions. The use of such
ciphers renders otherwise-legitimate encryption measures ineffective against sophisticated attacks.

**Proposal**

Change the default cipher list from ''DEFAULT'' to:

<code>
!SSLv2:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!LOW:!MD5:!DES:!ADH:!RC4:HIGH@STRENGTH
</code>

To see how this list translates in the real world:

<code>

$ openssl ciphers -v '!SSLv2:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!LOW:!MD5:!DES:!ADH:!RC4:HIGH@STRENGTH'

</code>

The first few ciphers in this list are denoted as [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_Ciphersuite|"Mandatory discards"]]
by Mozilla (''!SSLv2:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!LOW:!MD5:!DES:''). The other ciphers proposed for
exclusion have explanations below.

The main differences between these recommendations and the Mozilla list linked above are:

  * All ''HIGH'' ciphers are allowed in lieu of adding an endless string of specific cipher names that
may or may not be available on a given system.

  * ''RC4'' and ''ADH'' ciphers are additionally disabled (explanation below)

**Logic**

''!SSLv2''

  * The use of SSLv2 is widely and strongly discouraged and should not be enabled by default. Many OpenSSL libs are already compiled without SSLv2 support, but explicitly disallowing SSLv2 ciphers will provide more protection for users building ''ext/openssl'' against older libraries.

''!aNULL:!eNULL''

  * Prevent ciphers that do not require authentication or encryption (self-explanatory).

''!EXPORT:!LOW:!MD5:!DES''

  * Disallow ciphers known to be weak/broken/ineffective. The ciphers listed here (in addition to the above SSLv2 and NULL ciphers) compise Mozilla's list of [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_Ciphersuite|"Mandatory discards"]].

''!ADH''

  * TLS [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt|RFC2246 Section A.5]] states that ADH ciphers should be disallowed


''!RC4''

  * Reputable outlets now recommend against allowing RC4 ciphers:

  * [[https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/03/19/rc4-in-tls-is-broken-now-what|RC4 in TLS is Broken: Now What]]

  * [[http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/11/12/security-advisory-2868725-recommendation-to-disable-rc4.aspx|Microsoft Security Advisory 2868725: Recommendation to disable RC4]]

''@STRENGTH''

  * Order cipher preferences by strength


**Example**

<code php>
<?php

// New informational constant exposed to userland
var_dump(OPENSSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_CIPHERS);
// string(67) "!SSLv2:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!LOW:!MD5:!DES:!ADH:!RC4:HIGH@STRENGTH"

/**
 * All encrypted streams use the new default cipher list automatically
 */
$html = file_get_contents('https://somesite.com');


/**
 * Users may override the default ciphers at any time by manually specifying their own list via
 * the "ciphers" SSL context option.
 */
$context = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'ciphers' => 'HIGH:MEDIUM:LOW@SPEED'
]]);
$html = file_get_contents('https://somesite.com', null, $context);

?>
</code>

===== TLS Compression =====

As of PHP 5.4.13 users may specify the ''"disable_compression"'' SSL context option to mitigate the
CRIME attack vector. However, to benefit from this protection users must recognize the threat and
manually assign the relevant context option.

**Proposal**

  * Disable TLS compression by default.

**Logic**

Users are [[https://isecpartners.com/blog/2012/september/details-on-the-crime-attack.aspx|generally advised to disable compression]]
as a low-cost method for mitigating CRIME attacks. It's sensible to enable this protection by default
as users wishing to re-enable compression at the TLS layer may do so by assigning a falsy value to
the "disable_compression" SSL context option.

**Example**

Because this option will be enabled by default, users won't require any action to reap the benefits.
Users wishing to disable this setting may do so via the stream context as shown here:

<code php>
<?php

// How to enable TLS-layer compression (not recommended!)
$context = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'disable_compression' => FALSE
]]);

$uri = 'https://www.bankofamerica.com/';
$html = file_get_contents($uri, FALSE, $context);

?>
</code>


===== Honor Cipher Order =====

The [[http://contextis.com/research/blog/server-technologies-https-beast-attack/|BEAST]] TLS attack
vector was [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack|first publicized in 2011]].
Mitigating this attack is relatively simple: servers have only to [[https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/10/17/mitigating-the-beast-attack-on-tls|prioritize ciphers]]
that aren't susceptible to the attack. However, unless instructed otherwise, OpenSSL uses the client's
preferences when negotiating the cipher. To prevent nefarious (or naive) clients from prioritizing
susceptible ciphers servers should configure SSL sessions using the ''SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE''
OpenSSL context option.

**Proposal**

  * Add a new boolean ''"honor_cipher_order"'' ssl context option.

**Logic**

Exposing this capability to userland allows encrypted stream servers to transparently mitigate BEAST
vulnerabilities and control cipher ordering preferences during negotiation.

**Example**

<code php>
<?php

$context = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'honor_cipher_order' => TRUE
]]);

$uri = 'https://www.bankofamerica.com/';
$html = file_get_contents($uri, FALSE, $context);

?>
</code>


===== Verify Depth =====

**Proposal**

  * Use a default ''"verify_depth"'' value of 3

**Logic**

Users can control how deeply PHP should verify certificates before concluding that the peer's
certificate is invalid via the existing ''"verify_depth"'' context option. In these scenarios the
"depth" is the maximum allowed number of intermediate certificate issuers. So, for example, setting
''"verify_depth" => 0'' means that //only// self-signed client certificates would be accepted as
valid. By default PHP sets no limit on how deeply certificate chains can be verified.

This proposal specifies a default ''"verify_depth"'' of 3 if not specified by the user.

**Example**

<code php>
<?php

// New informational constant exposed to userland
var_dump(OPENSSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_VERIFY_DEPTH); // int(3)

$context = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'verify_depth' => 10 // Override the default value
]]);

$html = file_get_contents('https://www.bankofamerica.com/', FALSE, $context);

</code>


===== Stream Wrapper Creep =====

The following stream encryption wrappers currently exist in userland:

  * ''ssl''
  * ''sslv2''
  * ''sslv3''
  * ''tls''

Meanwhile, 5.6 has added the following new wrappers:

  * ''tlsv1.0''
  * ''tlsv1.1''
  * ''tlsv1.2''

**Yeah, So?**

The problem with this design should be obvious: it grows linearly as each new encryption protocol
is standardized and unleashed on the world. Choosing the correct wrapper is already a daunting task
for users unfamiliar with the various transport layer security protocols and this situation will only
deteriorate as new protocols are continuously adopted.

Beyond the "creep" of new stream wrappers there also exists a consistency problem. Do all users
understand that the ''ssl'' wrapper technically can negotiate //any// of the supported protocols? Do
they know that in contrast the ''tls'' wrapper will //only// negotiate TLSv1 and not the newer TLS
iterations? Do they realize that the ''ssl'' wrapper potentially exposes their transfers to the
broken/insecure SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols? How can they tell PHP to use (for example) only TLSv1.1
or TLSv1.2?

This design is confusing and has aged poorly in a world where new protocols arrive periodically to
address the shortcomings of previous iterations. Moreover, PHP is built on the foundation of hiding
these kinds of minute details from the user. Developers shouldn't //need// a full understanding of
the underlying transport layer security protocols to safely encrypt their transfers.

The goal must always be to make things "just work" in a secure manner without requiring user
knowledge of the underlying machinations.

**Source of the Problem**

This existing discrete stream wrapper approach is necessary because it depends on //value//
assignments to determine the encryption protocol instead of //flags//. This makes design choice
makes it impossible to achieve fine-grained control over which protocols are used without fractaling
out new constants for every conceivable combination of protocols. The "value" approach essentially
locks users into one of two choices:

  * Allow only one narrow protocol
  * Allow *ALL* of the protocols, even if some do not provide the requisite level of security

While this paradigm negatively impacts client-side applications, its shortcomings are particularly
acute for ''stream_socket_server()'' users who require fine-grained control over which protocols are
allowed in their servers. For example, a server may wish to allow //only// TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 to
maximize transmission safety. The existing paradigm makes this level of control impossible.

**Proposal**

  * Internally re-value the existing ''STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_*'' constants to allow the assignment of
crypto methods using bitwise flags instead of values. Users may specify any combination of these
constants to control the allowed protocols for a given client or server stream. Meanwhile, the
''"crypto_method"'' context option already included as part of 5.6 allows all code to specify
exactly which methods are appropriate for a given operation.
  * Remove the new stream wrappers previously merged for inclusion in 5.6:
        * ''tlsv1.0''
        * ''tlsv1.1''
        * ''tlsv1.2''
  * Deprecate the following stream wrappers in PHP 5.6 with removal (tentatively) scheduled for PHP 6:
        * ''sslv2''
        * ''sslv3''
        * ''tls''

**Logic**

The main reason for reshuffling the stream wrappers is simplicity. Most users are unlikely to know
the difference between the various protocols much less which they should use. It's not difficult to
imagine a scenario in which a user reasons, //"If SSL is safe, SSLv2 and SSLv3 must be REALLY safe.
I should use those."// Such users are likely to have no idea what "tls" means and forego it completely
despite its standing as the most secure option.

So the overarching goal in this change is two-fold:

  * Keep users safe by default without preventing them from doing insecure things if they need to do so;
  * Eliminate the confusion of having many different wrappers for encrypted streams. By deprecating
the superfluous stream wrappers we //simplify// the ecosystem at the same time we're actually
//adding// new functionality (via customized flag protocol specification).

The decision was made to retain ''ssl'' as the primary stream wrapper because the general developer
population is more familiar with what "SSL" means than "TLS." Encryption context options are also
specified using the ''"ssl"'' key so the choice remains consistent with the existing nomenclature.
Note again that these stream wrappers //are not// removed. Their use will trigger an
''E_DEPRECATED'' warning but they will continue to function as before.

Note also that though the ''tls'' stream wrapper is officially deprecated it will now negotiate the
best available of the TLS1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols. Because ''ext/openssl'' did not support
TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 prior to PHP 5.6 this wrapper was previously only able to utilize TLSv1.

**BC Implications of Proposed Stream Wrapper Changes**

//None.//

The only implications for existing code are the ''E_DEPRECATED'' messages for the ''sslv2'',
''sslv3'' and ''tls'' stream wrappers. Note that //only// stream wrapper usages trigger deprecation
notices. This notice triggering has nothing to do with the underlying protocols; it only occurs when
using the wrappers made unnecessary by the introduction of protocol flags. Users are encouraged to
specify protocol flags in their stream contexts to avoid these deprecation notices.

**Existing Constant Re-Valuing**

The existing constants are internally re-valued as shown below to allow their use as bitwise flags.
Because the existing code delineates between clients and servers the least significant bit is used
to differentiate between the two stream types.

<code c>
typedef enum {
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv2_CLIENT = (1 << 1 | 1),
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv3_CLIENT = (1 << 2 | 1),
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv23_CLIENT = ((1 << 1) | (1 << 2) | 1), /* SSLv2 or SSLv3 */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_0_CLIENT = (1 << 3 | 1), /* New in 5.6 */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_1_CLIENT = (1 << 4 | 1), /* New in 5.6 */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_CLIENT = (1 << 5 | 1), /* New in 5.6 */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLS_CLIENT = ((1 << 3) | (1 << 4) | (1 << 5) | 1), /* Any TLS protocol */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv2_SERVER = (1 << 1),
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv3_SERVER = (1 << 2),
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv23_SERVER = ((1 << 1) | (1 << 2)), /* SSLv2 or SSLv3 */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_0_SERVER = (1 << 3), /* New in 5.6 */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_1_SERVER = (1 << 4), /* New in 5.6 */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_SERVER = (1 << 5), /* New in 5.6 */
	STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLS_SERVER = ((1 << 3) | (1 << 4) | (1 << 5)) /* Any TLS protocol */
} php_stream_xport_crypt_method_t;
</code>

These internal constants map directly to the existing userland constants of the same name. Astute
readers may notice that the ''SSLv23'' constants do not carry the same meaning as previous versions
of the openssl extension. As far as the underlying OpenSSL library is concerned, ''SSLv23''
translates to "every protocol you can possibly support (including TLS protocols)." This reuse of a
legacy naming convention is a source of constant confusion for users not versed in the inner-workings
of OpenSSL. Here we use the more natural connotation and translate ''SSLv23'' for our purposes to
mean "either SSLv2 or SSLv3."

**Examples**

Automatically negotiate the best available encryption protocol supported by the server:

<code php>
<?php

$html = file_get_contents('https://github.com');

?>
</code>

Only allow TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2:

<code php>
<?php

$context = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'crypto_method' => STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLS_CLIENT
]]);
$html = file_get_contents('https://github.com');

?>
</code>

Use any combination of available flags to limit allowed protocols:

<code php>
<?php

$allowedProtocols = STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv3_CLIENT  | STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_CLIENT;
$context = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'crypto_method' => $allowedProtocols
]]);
$fp = fopen('https://www.google.com' . '/', 'r', false, $context);
if ($fp) {
    fpassthru($fp);
}

?>
</code>

Bind a socket server that only allows TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 connections:

<code php>
<?php

$allowedProtocols = STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_1_SERVER | STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_SERVER;
$context = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'crypto_method' => $allowedProtocols
]]);
$bindFlags = STREAM_SERVER_BIND | STREAM_SERVER_LISTEN;
$server = stream_socket_server('ssl://127.0.0.1:443', $errno, $errstr, $bindFlags, $context);

?>
</code>

Connect using the (deprecated) ''tls'' stream wrapper. The connection will negotiate the best
available protocol of TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2. The stream is created successfully and an
E_DEPRECATED error is triggered to encourage users to use the catch-all ''ssl'' wrapper:

<code php>
<?php

// Triggers E_DEPRECATED, still works
$sock = stream_socket_client('tls://github.com:443');

?>
</code>

The //only// wrapper for which the "crypto_method" flags have any effect is ''ssl''. Assigning this
context option for the deprecated wrappers has no effect:

<code php>
<?php

$context = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'crypto_method' => STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv3_CLIENT // <-- Won't work; you're stuck with TLS.
]]);

// Triggers E_DEPRECATED, still works
$sock = stream_socket_client('tls://github.com:443');

?>
</code>

There is no need to use the deprecated wrappers as the ''ssl'' wrapper automatically negotiates
the best available protocol. However, for the sake of completeness, note that the following still
works:

<code php>
<?php

$sock = stream_socket_client('sslv3://github.com:443'); // Triggers E_DEPRECATED, still works

?>
</code>

Enable crypto on an existing stream. Previously only a single value constant could be used at
parameter 3. Flags are now accepted as shown here:

<code php>
<?php

$cryptoMethod = STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_1_SERVER | STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_SERVER;
stream_socket_enable_crypto($stream , $enable = TRUE, $cryptoMethod);

?>
</code>


===== TL;DR Definitive Progress =====

**Requirements for a secure transfer prior to PHP 5.6:**

<code php>
<?php
$context = stream_context_create(array(
    'ssl' => array(
        'ciphers' => 'DO USERS KNOW WHAT TO PUT HERE? NO.',
        'verify_peer' => true,
        'cafile' => 'DO USERS KNOW WHAT TO PUT HERE? NO.',
        'CN_match' => 'somesite.com',
        'verify_depth' => 3,
        'disable_compression' => true,

        'SNI_server_name' => 'somesite.com'
    )
));

$html = file_get_contents('https://somesite.com', null, $context);
?>
</code>

**Requirements for a secure transfer in 5.6 without this proposal:**

<code php>
<?php
$context = stream_context_create(array(
    'ssl' => array(
        'ciphers' => 'DO USERS KNOW WHAT TO PUT HERE? NO.',
        'verify_depth' => 3,
        'disable_compression' => true
    )
));

$html = file_get_contents('https://somesite.com', null, $context);
?>
</code>


**Requirements for a secure transfer in 5.6 if this RFC passes:**

Users are encouraged to merge the provided patch and view the HTML returned in the following code
which accesses "howsmyssl.com" (a general gauge of the security measures of your client).

<code php>
<?php
$html = file_get_contents('https://howsmyssl.com');
?>
</code>


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Most existing code is expected work without any BC implications. The only source of potential breakage
involves the scenario where users connect to servers employing outdated/insecure encryption technologies.
For these users the option always exists to manually override secure defaults with insecure settings
in the stream context.

===== Proposed PHP Version =====

This RFC is proposed for implementation in PHP 5.6.

===== New Constants =====

''OPENSSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_CIPHERS''

Provides userland access to the default cipher list used for stream encryption

''OPENSSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_VERIFY_DEPTH''

Provides userland access to the default verify depth used for stream encryption

''STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_0_CLIENT''

Flag allowing specific TLSv1 usage in encrypted client streams

''STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_0_SERVER''

Flag allowing specific TLSv1 usage in encrypted server streams
