====== PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 8.0 ======
  * Date: 2019-07-23
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>, George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.0 and remove it in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * ''date_sunrise()'' and ''date_sunset()''
  * ''key()'', ''current()'', ''next()'', ''prev()'', and ''reset()'' on objects
  * ''mb_check_encoding()'' without argument
  * ''get_class()'', ''get_parent_class()'' and ''get_called_class()'' without argument
  * ''FILE_BINARY'' and ''FILE_TEXT'' constants
  * Passing bool for ''$amountOrUpOrDown'' argument of ''IntlCalendar::roll()''
  * Accessing static members on traits

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.0 and removal in PHP 9.0.

==== date_sunrise() and date_sunset() ====

These two functions have the signature:

<PHP>
function date_sunset(
    int $timestamp,
    int $format = SUNFUNCS_RET_STRING,
    float $latitude = ini_get("date.default_latitude"),
    float $longitude = ini_get("date.default_longitude"),
    float $zenith = ini_get("date.sunset_zenith"),
    float $gmt_offset = 0
): mixed;
</PHP>

This function depends on ini settings that specify the "default" latitude and longitude, a concept that makes very little sense. Additionally it requires familiarity with appropriate zenith values to use for different purposes.

''date_sunset()'' and ''date_sunrise()'' have since been superseded by ''date_sun_info()'':

<PHP>
function date_sun_info(int $time, float $latitude, float $longitude): array;
</PHP>

This function does not use "default" latitude and longitude, and returns an associative array of multiple different definitions of the sunrise/sunset concept.

The proposal is to deprecate ''date_sunset()'' and ''date_sunrise()'' in favor of ''date_sun_info()''. The ini settings ''date.default_latitude'', ''date.default_longitude'' and ''date.sunset_zenith'' are marked as deprecated in the documentation. In the next major version, both the functions and the ini settings will be removed.
This was initially discussed in: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4423.

==== key(), current(), next(), prev(), reset() on objects ====

The ''key()'' family of functions, which are used to manipulate the internal array pointer, also accept objects. In this case they work on the mangled property table. That is, using ''key()'' and friends on an object is essentially the same as using them on ''get_mangled_object_vars($object)''.

This catches many people off guard, because they expect ''key()'' etc. to integrate with the iterator interface. That is, if the passed object implements ''Iterator'' then ''key($object)'' should perform an ''$object->key()'' call. The water here have been further muddied by ''ArrayObject'', which prior to PHP 7.4 was the only object where ''key()'' etc. //did// effectively integrate with the iterator interface.

There are principally two ways to resolve this: The first is to deprecate the use of ''key()'' etc on objects, and instead require people to perform an explicit ''(array)'' cast or ''get_mangled_object_vars()'' call beforehand. The other is to actually make these functions integrate with iterators. The issue I see with the latter is that we would only be able to support the ''Iterator'' interface proper, but general ''Traversable''s: For these ''IteratorAggregate::getIterator()'', or the internal ''get_iterator()'' handler need to be called once at the start, which is not possible through the array iteration interface, as it consists of multiple independent functions. Additionally, the ''prev()'' function cannot be implemented for iterators.

As such, the proposal is to deprecate key(), current(), next(), prev() and reset() on objects. The suggested replacement is to cast the object to array first, or call ''get_mangled_object_vars()'', depending on what the intention is.

==== mb_check_encoding() without argument ====

The ''mb_check_encoding()'' usually accepts a string and an encoding, but can also be called without arguments. The documentation says:

> If it is omitted, this function checks all the input from the beginning of the request. 

The implementation says:

<code>
/* FIXME: Actually check all inputs, except $_FILES file content. */
if (MBSTRG(illegalchars) == 0) {
    RETURN_TRUE;
}
RETURN_FALSE;
</code>

This %%FIXME%% does not induce a sense of confidence in this function...

Further research shows that the documentation is correct, in that //any// encoding checking or conversion functionality invoked during a request will increment ''MBSTRG(illegalchars)''. As such, ''mb_check_encoding()'' tells you whether any illegal encoding has been encountered at any point. My best guess is that this was intended to be used in conjunction with the ''encoding_translation'' feature, which "treats" incoming SAPI data.

Overall this functionality is confusing, and the implementation is unfinished or broken. There are no calls to ''mb_check_encoding()'' without argument in popular composer packages.

The proposal is to deprecate calling ''mb_check_encoding()'' without arguments.

==== get_class(), get_parent_class() and get_called_class() without argument ====

In PHP 7.2, [[rfc:get_class_disallow_null_parameter|passing null to ''get_class()'']] was forbidden, because this behavior was very bug prone. However, the ability to call ''get_class()'' without argument was retained. In that case ''get_class()'' is approximately the same as ''self::class''. ''get_parent_class()'' exhibits the same behavior.

The proposal is to deprecate argument-less ''get_class()'', ''get_parent_class()'' and ''get_called_class()'' in favor of the dedicated ''self::class'', ''parent::class'' and ''static::class'' syntax, which was introduced in PHP 5.5. (''get_called_class()'' only has an argument-less form, so it would be deprecated entirely.)

As a caveat, if ''get_parent_class()'' is used to check whether the class has a parent, it is necessary to use ''get_parent_class(self::class)'' instead, because ''parent::class'' will generate an error if used inside a class without parent.

==== FILE_BINARY and FILE_TEXT constants ====

These were introduced in PHP 5.2.7 for forward compatibility with PHP 6, but don't have any effect. These constants are especially confusing because ''fopen()'' supports ''b'' (binary) and ''t'' (text) modes, which //do// have an effect. Namely, they control handling of newlines on Windows.

The proposal is to deprecate the ''FILE_BINARY'' and ''FILE_TEXT'' constants.

This was pointed out in: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5556

==== Passing bool for $amountOrUpOrDown argument of IntlCalendar::roll() ====

<php>IntlCalendar::roll()</php> accepts an integer which specifies how much to add to a given field. The integer can be negative to subtract.

However, it also accepts a boolean argument, in which case ''true'' is interpreted as ''1'' and ''false'' is interpreted as ''-1''. This does not appear to be actually useful for anything, makes for a confusing function signature, and violates PHP's usual type coercion rules.

The proposal is to deprecate passing a boolean to this method argument.

==== Accessing static members on traits ====

Currently, it is possible to directly access static trait members, rather than accessing them on the class using the trait:

<PHP>
trait T {
    public static $foo;
}
class C {
    use T;
}
var_dump(T::$foo); // Allowed.
</PHP>

This is conceptually wrong, and causes various complications. For example, the meaning of ''self'' is ill-defined (which normally refers to the using class, not the trait), the behavior of static variables in methods may change depending on whether a trait method has been called prior to being used, and opcache preloading requires constant initializers in traits to be fully resolved (as they may be used directly).

There is a somewhat dated analysis of projects using this "feature" at https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4829#issuecomment-542224541.

The proposal is to deprecate the ability to access static properties and static methods directly on traits.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.0 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 9.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.

===== Removed from this proposal =====

The following entries were originally added to this proposal and then dropped.

==== DateTimeInterface::ISOISO8601 ====

Explain why.

==== get_browser() function ====

Explain why.
