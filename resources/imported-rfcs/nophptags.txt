This RFC proposes removal of PHP tags (''<?php'' and so forth) from the PHP script by php.ini or CLI option flags.

===== Background =====

=== Mandatory Embed mode ＝ Less Security ===

Current PHP is weak to script injections compare to other languages such as Ruby/Perl/Phthon/Lua/etc. There are countermeasures allow_url_include=off and Null byte check in fopen wrapper, but injecting PHP scripts in a file is easy. Simple vulnerability in include()/require() could result in a fatal security incident.

PHP script inclusion detection may be done for data files. However, it's not a simple task.

  * <?, <% should be checked even if it's a binary. It's possible to have "<?" or "<%" in a binary. One should check if it contains a valid(executable) PHP script in it or not.
  * <script language="php"> should be checked. "<script language=" is common in HTML files. Checking "<script language=" is not a simple task.
  * Almost all applications are not checking these and it would be impossible to make developers do a proper validation.

Disabling embed(template) mode is simple solution for this issue.

Note: Null byte in path parameter invalidated in fopen wrapper. It reduced the LFI(Local File Include) risk greatly. This proposal aims to reduce the LFI risk to other scripting language level.

=== PHP script injection examples ===

== Novice Mistakes ==
Common novice PHP programmer mistake is writing code like

  include $_GET['name'];

Because PHP is embedded language and the nature of embedded language cannot be changed, this kind of code raises fatal security issues. Attacker may use any uploaded files without proper validations may be used to execute PHP code. Attacker may also be read any files with permissions.

Note: Please keep in mind that this RFC aims to reduce LFI risk without full knowledge of LFI. Not many people realizes that LFI may be used with SQL Injection and the Null Byte protection does not help at all for this case.

== Session Data ==
Many applications store user inputs in $_SESSION array and use files are session storage. If attacker can inject PHP script in $_SESSION array, all they have to do is find a vulnerable include()/require(). Session save_path could be guessed easily. 

Attacker may

  - Find LFI
  - Find a way to inject PHP script in $_SESSION
  - Guess session save_path
  - Take over target server

== Cached Data ==
Modern applications cache data into files for better performance. Since cache is only used by application, programmers do not care if it contains PHP code or not. Attacker may follow similar steps to execute attack script.

== Email ==
Some applications save email messages.

== Log Files ==
Errors are logged usually. 

== SQL injection ==
SQL injection is known to be able executing arbitrarily code by itself with certain configuration. With PHP's LFI, SQL injection may be used for arbitrarily code execution since many SQL database servers support writing data to a file.

Since attacker has **control of full file name**, Null Byte protection does not work at all.

When LFI and SQL Injection can be abused, attacker may steal data without blind SQL injection. Attacker may simply dump data into file and use LFI steal it. 

=== LFI is NOT only for execution ===

FLI does not have to be script execution due to current mandatory embedded language nature. 

  include $_REQUEST['var'];

Above code may be used to read sensitive data such as /etc/passwd, .htaccess, .htpasswd or any other file attacker may interested. 

=== Recent PHP usage ===

Since PHP was given birth by Rasmus Lerdorf as a tiny form interpreter for personal use, it has much evolved into a general-purpose scripting language, and is considered to be part of core technologies that are the basis of busiest websites to date.

The design of the language is comparable with its notable successors such as ASP (Active Server Pages) and JSP (Java Server Pages), in which one can easily build a dynamic web page by interleaving presentation elements with application logics, and it was well received by many developers who had to tackle with CGI at the time it got an attention.

However, as web application development got its way in the industry, it was discovered that MVC (model-view-controller) architecture, which effectively promotes the separation of concerns between the domain logic (models) and the presentation logic (views), could be the key concept of many kinds of web applications as well as GUI applications to build maintainable pieces of software.

At the same time, various web security issues became subject to public concern and the 'interleaving' method was pointed out to be too error-prone to create a secure website as it completely dismisses the context of the presentation elements where the application logic is inserted and so forces one to choose the correct escaping method suitable for putting the result of the logic in that place.

And today, many PHP programmers usually choose to use a web application framework that is based on MVC architecture and also takes advantage of modern template engines that feature handy syntax specific to describe common presentation logics. Not a few programmers may once have been bothered to put a PHP tag at the top of every PHP script that only contains classes and functions. In short, PHP tags are just ancient.

===== Proposal =====

  * Add flag that controls embed(template) feature of PHP.

Flag to control embed (template) mode

php.ini

  template_mode = on   ; On by default. INI_ALL
                       ; On: "<?php" or like is requried.
                       ; Off: No open tag is required.

CLI

  php -t foo.php  # template mode. "<?php" is required. Default.
  php -T foo.php  # non-template mode. "<?php" is NOT required.

  * Allow users to start PHP statements from the top of the script without putting open tags such as ''<?php''.
  * Complete removal of esoretic ''<script lanuage="PHP">'' open tag.
  * Allow open tags (''<?php'', ''<?'', ''<%'') only at the top of the script for compatibility, and issue a parse error when used in other places.
  * Ignore close tags (''?>'' and ''%>'') completely.

===== Example Usage =====

==== Mode control ====

Modern frameworks have single bootstrap script and template rendering function.

In bootstrap script
  ini_set('template_mode', 'off'); // Older PHP ignores

In template rendering function
  function render_template($template, $template_vars) {
    ini_set('template_mode', 'on);  // Older PHP ignores
    // Do what ever required as template
    ini_set('template_mode', 'off');  // Older PHP ignores
  }

This piece of code work with/without this RFC. It would not be affected by php.ini, since it works for both template_mode=on/off.

==== Data File Validation ====

With this RFC, the only allowed PHP tag under non embed mode is "<?php". "<?php" should be at the beginning of a file. Programmer can check if a data file is PHP script or not by simple substr().

  $sig = substr($data_file, 0, 4);
  if (strtolower($sig) === '<?php') {
     trigger_error('Invalid Data File Header: '.$sig);
     die('You may not use PHP script as a data file');
  }
