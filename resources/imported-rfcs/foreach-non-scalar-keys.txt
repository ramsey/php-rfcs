===== Current situation =====

The ''Iterator::key'' function can currently return a value of any type, but the handling code in ''foreach'' and several other places only allows integer and string keys to be used. This limitation makes some use-cases unnecessarily complicated. From the SPL two examples are ''MultipleIterator'' and ''SplObjectStorage''.

The ''MutlipleIterator'' allows you to traverse several ''Iterator''s at the same time. It's ''::current'' method returns an array of values and the ''::key'' method returns an array of keys. But due to the ''foreach'' key type limitation the keys can not be directly fetched:

<code php>
$it = new MultipleIterator;
$it->attachIterator($it1);
$it->attachIterator($it2);

// This is NOT possible
foreach ($it as $keys => $values) {
    // ...
}

// Instead you have to use this
foreach ($it as $values) {
    $keys = $it->keys();
    
    // ...
}
</code>

''SplObjectStorage'' is a map/set implementation for object keys. Here the issue is circumvented by returning the keys as values and requiring a manual lookup on the values:

<code php>
// NOT possible
foreach ($objectStore as $key => $value) {
    // ...
}

// Instead you have to use
foreach ($objectStore as $key) {
    $value = $objectStore[$key];
    
    // ...
}
</code>

These are just two examples from core classes, but it obviously also applies in many other cases (and now that we have generators, it will probably become an even larger issue).

Another key issue is that you can't really work around this generically. If you want to write code that is also compatible with ''Iterator''s that return array/object keys, you can no longer use the ''foreach ($it as $k => $v)'' syntax. You are forced to use ''foreach ($it as $v) { $k = $it->key(); ... }'', but this will obviously only with with ''Iterator''s and not with aggregates, ''Traversable''s or normal arrays. In order to properly support all use cases you'd have to wrap everything in iterators (i.e. make extensive use of ''IteratorIterator'' and ''ArrayIterator''), which obviously is an option, but cumbersome to a degree that nobody does it. What this means is that iterators like ''MultipleIterator'' are to a large part excluded from use in iterator chaining/pipelines (which is probably the most important thing about using iterators).

===== Suggested fix =====

This RFC proposes to lift the restriction and allow values of arbitrary types to be used as keys (in particularly allowing also arrays and objects) in iterators. (Note: This proposal does not suggest allowing those key types in arrays. This is only about ''Iterator''s.)

In order to remove this restriction the internal [[http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_TRUNK/Zend/zend_iterators.h#31|''zend_object_iterator_funcs'']] API has to be changed:

<code c>
// This entry:
int (*get_current_key)(zend_object_iterator *iter, char **str_key, uint *str_key_len, ulong *int_key TSRMLS_DC);
// Is replaced with this entry:
zval *(*get_current_key)(zend_object_iterator *iter TSRMLS_DC);
</code>

The handler will return a ''zval*'' with already increased refcount. The ''zval*'' may not be ''NULL'', unless an exception was thrown.

The signature can use ''zval*'' instead of ''zval**'' because by-ref modification of keys is not possible. The refcount is increased in the handler (instead of the VM) as that turned out to be the more convenient method for this use case.

===== Patch =====

A preliminary patch implementing the above proposal can be found here: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/278

The change itself is rather small, but there are quite a few extensions that require minor adjustments to use the new API.

===== Open questions =====

The main open question are iterator/array interactions, e.g. when an iterator is converted to an array with ''iterator_to_array''. What should be done with the keys that are valid in the iterator, but not in the array? I think the best approach would be to just set the array keys with the exact same semantics as PHP would do (i.e. with all casts and warnings). I couldn't yet find a function in the API that does this though. Maybe have to expose the inline functions from ''zend_execute.c'' for that :)
