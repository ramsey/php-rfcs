====== PHP RFC: Write-Once Properties ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2020-02-18
  * Author: Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>
  * Target Version: PHP 8.0
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5186

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes to add support for a new property modifier that would allow properties to be initialized, but not modified afterwards. This feature would be useful in situations where one wants to guarantee that a property remains the same for the lifetime of an object - which is usually the case for Value Objects or Data Transfer Objects. Other languages, like Java and C# also have similar - but not exactly the same - concepts for a long time (''final'' and ''readonly'' respectively).

===== Proposal =====

==== Run-time behaviour ====

"Write-once" properties in PHP (the actual keyword is to be decided) could be initialized by an assignment operation. Contrary to how ''final'' properties in Java work, this RFC proposes to allow the initialization of object properties after object construction. The main purpose of choosing this approach is to make lazy loading possible - which is an important aspect for many PHP applications. In addition to object properties, class properties can also use the modifier in question with the same rules.

As soon as initialization is done, any other attempt to assign a value to "write-once" properties results in an exception. Besides assignment, the increment, decrement, and unset operations are also forbidden. As arrays are an immutable data structure in PHP, any attempt to mutate a property of array type (adding/removing/changing items) is forbidden. However, properties that have an object type still remain mutable internally (see example below). In order to avoid possible problems, references on "write-once" properties are forbidden as well.

<code php>

class Foo
{
    <keyword> public int $a;
    <keyword> public array $b;
    <keyword> public object $c;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->a = 1;
        $this->b = ["foo"];
    }
}

$foo = new Foo();

$foo->a = 2;		// EXCEPTION: property a has already been initialized
$foo->a++;		// EXCEPTION: incrementing/decrementing is forbidden
unset($foo->b);		// EXCEPTION: unsetting is forbidden
$foo->b[] = "bar";	// EXCEPTION: array values can't be modified
next($foo->b);		// EXCEPTION: internal pointer of arrays can't be modified as well
$var = &$this->b;	// EXCEPTION: reference isn't allowed
$this->b; = &$var;	// EXCEPTION: reference isn't allowed

key($foo->b);			// SUCCESS: internal pointer of arrays is possible to read
$foo->c = new stdClass();	// SUCCESS: property c hasn't been initialized before
$foo->c->foo = "foo";		// SUCCESS: objects are still mutable internally

</code>

Furthermore, cloning objects with "write-once" properties is supported, in which case properties remain in the state (initialized/uninitialized) they were before. In other words, once a "write-once" property is initialized, it can't be changed after cloning. If you still want to modify them, you have to create a new object. Although this behaviour might be inconvenient in some cases, I decided not to address the problem in the current RFC in order to reduce its scope. The solution could be to add support for either object initializers or property mutation **during** the ''clone'' operation. As these features are neither a prerequisite for "write-once" properties, nor a trivial problem, it's better to properly discuss the question on its own.

==== Compile-type restrictions ====

As untyped properties have an implicit default value (''null'') in the absense of an explicit one, their usefulness would be very limited. In order to avoid the introduction of unintiutive workarounds, this RFC proposes to disable the property modifier in question for them. Contrarily to untyped properties, typed properties are in uninitialized state by default (meaning, they don't have a value yet), so they play well with the write-once semantics.

This choice has a slightly inconvenient implication of not being able to use "write-once" properties together with resources - since PHP doesn't have the ''resource'' type declaration. Currently, a possible workaround is to wrap resources in objects, but another way to solve the issue could be provided from PHP's side by adding support for a ''mixed'' type.

Another restriction of "write-once" properties is that they can't have a default value. Thus, the following syntax is forbidden:

<code php>

class Foo {
    public int $a = 0;
}

</code>

Instead, property ''$a'' should be initialized via an assignment either in the constructor or somewhere else. The purpose of this restriction is to avoid offering two syntaxes for declaring class constants as well as keeping our freedom to add new features to PHP that would otherwise have the possibility to interfere with the semantics of default values of "write-once" properties.


Furthermore, the introduction of "write-once" properties impose slight changes to property variance validation. Namely, "write-once" properties must not override regular properties because the parent class expects them to be mutable. That's why the following example results in a compilation error:

<code php>

class Foo {
    public int $a;
}

class Bar extends Foo {
    <keyword> public int $a;
}

</code>

However, regular properties can override "write-once" properties like below:

<code php>

class Foo {
    <keyword> public int $a;
}

class Bar extends Foo {
    public int $a;
}

</code>

==== Serialization ====

"Write-once" properties can be serialized just like other properties. However, a new rule will apply to them: malformed serialized data which sets a "write-once" property multiple times throws an exception.

==== Reflection ====

At last, I'm proposing to add a new ''ReflectionProperty'' method with which it would be possible to retrieve if a property has the modifier in question. Depending on the keyword choice, I'd suggest using the ''isImmutable()'', ''isLocked()'', ''isReadonly()'', or ''isWriteonce()'' method names.

===== Alternative Approaches =====
As there are quite a few alternatives to implement a similar feature, I would like to highlight why the current one was chosen. Please find below a short evaluation about the various possibilities that were also considered, but got rejected.

==== Read-only semantics ====
This is the implementation that Java and C# both use. It has really clear rules: a ''final'' or ''readonly'' property has to be initialized before object construction ends by assigning value to them exactly once, and no further changes are allowed afterwards. On the plus side, we can always be sure that a property has a value, but the downside is that lazy initialization is not possible anymore with this approach. Apart from the (unnecessarily) strict behaviour, another problem is that this implementation is hardly applicable in PHP where object construction is a "fuzzy" term.

==== Write-before-construction semantics ====
According to this idea, a property could be assigned to multiple times before object construction ends, and no further changes would be allowed from that point on. Even though this approach makes it easier to deal with bigger class hierarchies (in which case it's likely that multiple constructors are involved in object creation, increasing the chance of assigning to the same property multiple times), it also has the same disadvantages as the read-only approach.

==== Property accessors ====
Although actually "write-once" properties and property accessors are orthogonal to each other, it's arguable whether we still needed "write-once" properties if we had property accessors. The case against having both features is that property accessors can alone prevent unwanted or unintended modifications while guaranteeing read access to the properties. The only problem with solely relying on property accessors is that they can't prevent changes in the private/protected scope (depending on visibility). Furthermore, there are quite a few easy, but admittedly esoteric ways to circumvent visibility protections (see my examples at the following link: https://3v4l.org/fNTRa). This is the reason why we currently don't have any way to ensure the immutability of a property  - and property accessors wouldn't change this fact.

===== Open Questions =====
As there is no consensus about the name of the modifier, I'd like to put it to vote. You can find below the ideas that came up during discussion along with some pros/cons:

  * ''final'': This keyword currently affects inheritance, but not mutability rules in PHP, thus a ''final'' property modifier would be confusing in this form
  * ''sealed'': This keyword affects inheritance rules in other languages (e.g. in C#), thus it is also not a good candidate in our case
  * ''immutable'': It's a descriptive name which sounds well, although it's also a little bit misleading since its usage with mutable data structures (objects, resources) are not restricted in any way
  * ''locked'': Although ''locked'' sounds well, it's little bit vague a term that doesn't tell much about the feature. But at least it's not misleading.
  * ''writeonce'': It's the most technically accurate name, however, it sounds exotic, and it might be confusing from the end-user perspective, as they are generally not expected to write these properties
  * ''readonly'':  Although it's not as technically accurate as "writeonce", it represent the feature perfectly for end-users who are expected to only read these properties. C# also uses the same term for a similar purpose.

Considering the above, ''immutable'', ''locked'', ''writeonce'', and ''readonly'' are going to be proposed as voting choices of the decision about the keyword.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There are no backward incompatible changes in this proposal except for the fact that ''immutable'', ''locked'', ''writeonce'', or ''readonly'' would become a reserved keyword depending on the outcome of the secondary vote.

===== Future Scope =====
Adding support for "write-once" properties would lay the groundwork for immutable objects - for which I'm going to create a proposal should the current RFC be accepted. I also plan to address the problem with cloning mentioned in the "Proposal" section.

Additionally, as mentioned in the "Compile-Type Restrictions" section, adding support for the ''mixed'' type would make it possible to use "write-once" properties together with resources. Besides this, we could allow the definition of default values later on as soon as we have a good use-case for them.

Finally, "write-once" properties could in principle support covariance. That is, a subclass would be allowed to tighten the property type that is inherited from the parent class, while other properties must stay invariant. All this would be possible because of the quasi-immutable nature of "write-once" properties: they are generally expected to be assigned to only once, in the constructor - which is exempt from LSP checks. There is a gotcha though: in practice, "write-once" properties could be written from places other than the constructor. Although there might not be many practical use-cases for it, the infamous setter injection is certainly one (as shown at https://3v4l.org/DQ3To), in which case property covariance would be a problem.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
The primary vote ("Do you want to add support for the proposed property modifier?") requires 2/3 majority, while the secondary one ("Which keyword to use"?) requires a simple majority.
