====== PHP RFC: Removal of dead SAPIs ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2014-01-24
  * Author: Anatol Belski, <ab@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/removal_of_dead_sapis

===== Introduction =====

 Currently PHP contains many SAPIs to the servers either completely unavailable or unsupported for a long time. The corresponding list 

 Dead SAPIs:
  * aolserver
  * apache
  * apache2filter
  * apache_hooks
  * caudium
  * continuity
  * isapi
  * litespeed
  * milter
  * nsapi
  * phttpd
  * pi3web
  * roxen
  * thttpd
  * tux
  * webjames

 Maintained SAPIs:
  * apache2handler
  * cli
  * cgi
  * embed
  * fpm
  * phpdbg

It's insensible or impossible to check if a dead SAPI could be brought to life with the modern PHP. Either no sources can be found, sources are too old or no corresponding packages of a server itself or the SAPI builds do exist in either distributions.

===== Proposal =====

Dead SAPIs should be removed.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

As the dead SAPIs are already dead, no BC breach is expected.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
5.6

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

Dead SAPI list in the description.

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

None.

===== php.ini Defaults =====

php.ini will have to be checked to remove the unavailable config options, if any.

===== Open Issues =====

Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

None.

===== Future Scope =====

Should an SAPI come back, the corresponding code is available in the git history.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Remove dead SAPIs: yes/no

  - the version(s) it was merged to
