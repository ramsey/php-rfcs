====== PHP RFC: Removal of dead SAPIs ======
  * Version: 0.5
  * Date: 2014-01-24
  * Author: Anatol Belski, <ab@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/removal_of_dead_sapis

===== Introduction =====

 Currently PHP contains many SAPIs to the servers either completely unavailable or unsupported for a long time. The corresponding list 

 Dead SAPIs:
  * aolserver
  * apache
  * apache_hooks
  * caudium
  * continuity
  * isapi
  * litespeed
  * milter
  * nsapi
  * phttpd
  * pi3web
  * roxen
  * thttpd
  * tux
  * webjames
  * apache2filter - not really dead, but currently broken

 Maintained SAPIs:
  * apache2handler
  * cli
  * cgi
  * embed
  * fpm
  * phpdbg

\\
Things required to be done for the final decisions:
  * research the author names
  * articulate the exact state of each dead SAPI
  * articulate the exact state and availability of the corresponding server
  * if possible and makes sense, check if the SAPIs compiles, even with very ancient but latest release of the server
  * check if there are packages supported by distros
  * notify the authors about a possible removal of the corresponding SAPI, wait for their response and include it for the final decision

This RFC crosses with https://wiki.php.net/rfc/size_t_and_int64 as removal of the dead SAPIs will exlude the need of their porting.

===== Proposal =====

Dead SAPIs should be removed.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

As the dead SAPIs are already dead, no BC breach is expected.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
5.6

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

Dead SAPI list in the description.

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

None.

===== php.ini Defaults =====

php.ini will have to be checked to remove the unavailable config options, if any.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

None.

===== Future Scope =====

Should an SAPI come back, the corresponding code is available in the git history.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Remove dead SAPIs: yes/no

===== Patches and Tests =====

Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====

Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====
