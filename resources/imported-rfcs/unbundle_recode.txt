====== PHP RFC: Unbundle ext/recode ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-06-14
  * Author: Christoph M. Becker, cmb@php.net
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

ext/recode facilitates conversion between different character sets/encodings. This functionality is basically already supported by ext/iconv and ext/mbstring.  While the two latter extensions rely on POSIX iconv support or libiconv, and the bundled libmbfl, respectively, ext/recode relies on the [[https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Recode|Recode library]] which is **decomissioned** and had its latest release on 22 January 2001.

Even worse, at least according to [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/recode.requirements.php|our documentation]] the latest version (3.6.0) has unresolved issues, so we recommend using Recode 3.5, which is unlikely to be still provided by contemporary OS distributions.  Furthermore, the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/recode.installation.php|PHP manual]] mentions collisions with some other extensions, which appear to be still unresolved.

===== Proposal =====

For the reasons mentionend in the introduction section, I propose to unbundle ext/recode. 

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Obviously, code using ext/recode would either have to be ported to use ext/iconv or ext/mbstring instead, or such code 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

The unbundling should be done for PHP 7.4.

===== Open Issues =====

Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Unbundle ext/recode: yes or no.

===== Patches and Tests =====

No patch required.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
