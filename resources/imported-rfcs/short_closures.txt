====== PHP RFC: Short Closures ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2015-05-01
  * Author: Bob Weinand, bobwei9@hotmail.com
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/short_closures

===== Introduction =====
When writing partial functions, quick Closures to be applied to an array, or just a minimal lambda to do nothing, we always have to do this tedious work and write //function () use ($thousand, $vars) { return $thousand * $vars; }// — This whole boilerplate. It just doesn't read nor write nicely inlined in a line. Therefore this RFC to make code more legible and writeable.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes the introduction of the ~> operator.

The ~> operator defines a shorthand Closure which automatically use()'s all the used compiled variables (means: variable variables, compact() etc. won't be imported from defining call frame, only normally defined $variables).

Concrete syntax is (~> is right associative with highest possible associativity):
<code>
  ( parameter_list ) ~> expression
| ( parameter_list ) ~> { statements }
/* return by reference */
| &( parameter_list ) ~> expression
| &( parameter_list ) ~> { statements }
/* shorthand form for just one parameter */
| $variable ~> expression
| $variable ~> { statements }
</code>
When a bare expression is used as second parameter, its result will be the return value of the Closure.

===== Examples =====
==== Partial application ====
<code php>
function partialAdd() {
    return $left ~> $right ~> $left + $right;
}

/* Just to compare to the old equivalent */
function partialAdd() {
    return function($left) {
        return function($right) use ($left) {
            return $left + $right;
        }
    }
}
</code>
<code php>
/* Thanks to Levi Morrison for that example */
function reduce(callable $fn) {
    return $initial ~> $input ~> {
        $accumulator = $initial;
        foreach ($input as $value) {
            $accumulator = $fn($accumulator, $value);
        }
        return $accumulator;
    };
}

/* Compared to */
function reduce(callable $fn) {
    return function($initial) use ($fn) {
        return function ($input) use ($fn, $initial) {
            $accumulator = $initial;
            foreach ($input as $value) {
                $accumulator = $fn($accumulator, $value);
            }
            return $accumulator;
        };
    };
}
</code>

==== Quick applications to arrays ====
<code php>
/* Get a range from 2 to 10 with increment 2 */
$array = array_map($x ~> $x * 2, range(1, 5));

/* Compared to */
foreach (range(1, 5) as $x) {
    $array[] = $x * 2;
}
/* or */
$array = array_map(function($x) { return $x * 2; }, range(1, 5));
</code>

<code php>
/* Let $array be an array filled with objects having property val. Sort them in reverse by that property. */
usort($array, ($a, $b) ~> -($a->val <=> $b->val));

/* Compared to */
usort($array, function($a, $b) { return -($a->val <=> $b->val); });
/* ... which will be probably multilined in a lot of places... */
usort($array, function($a, $b) {
    return -($a->val <=> $b->val);
});
</code>

===== General thoughts =====
==== Do we really need this? ====
Ultimately, it does not add any additional possibilities which weren't already possible.

But it prevents us from having to write too much boilerplate, always write //use ($shit, $load, $of, $variables)//. In addition it saves the function and return keywords, which are not always helpful in circumstances where we just want a quick one liner to manipulate a structure or value.

Aside from that, it encourages (or makes it at least much tedious task) functional code and partial applications (see the examples), which may be a powerful tool the language shouldn't prevent.

==== Why ~> ? ====
Hack has %%==>%%, so, why then ~>?

~> has the advantage of being shorter and it doesn't look like a %%=>%%.

That's why this RFC proposes to use ~>.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This RFC doesn't affect backwards compatibility.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 7.x; actually 7.1.

===== Future Scope =====
This RFC _does not_ propose shorthand methods like
<code php>
class Foo {
    private $bar:

    getBar ~> $this->bar;
    setBar($bar) ~> $this->bar = $bar;
}
</code>

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This RFC is a language change and as such needs a 2/3 majority.
