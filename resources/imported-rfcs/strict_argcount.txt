====== PHP RFC: Context Sensitive Lexer ======
  * Version: 0.4
  * Date: 2015-02-15
  * Author: Márcio Almada
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/context_sensitive_lexer

===== Introduction =====

PHP currently has around **64** globally reserved words.
Not infrequently, these reserved words end up clashing with legit alternatives to userland API declarations.
This RFC proposes a partial solution to this by adding minimal changes to have a **context sensitive lexer**
with support for **semi-reserved** words.

For instance, if the RFC gets accepted, code like the following would become possible:

<code php>
class Collection {
    public function forEach(callable $callback) { /* */ }
    public function list() { /* */ }
}

</code>

Notice that it's currently **not** possible to have the ''foreach'' and ''list'' method delcared without having a syntax error:

  PHP Parse error: Syntax error, unexpected T_FOREACH, expecting T_STRING on line 2
  PHP Parse error: Syntax error, unexpected T_LIST, expecting T_STRING on line 3

===== Proposal =====

This RFC revisits the topic of [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/keywords_as_identifiers|Keywords as Identifiers]] RFC. But this time
presenting a minimal and maintainable [[https://github.com/marcioAlmada/php-src/commit/d9d6f0c7e325dcd0d0ff3c3f2dc73c2364c3ad5f|patch]],
restricted to OO scope only, consistently comprehending:

  * Properties, constants and methods defined on classes, interfaces and traits
  * Access of properties, constants and methods from objects and classes

The proposed changes could be especially useful to:

  - Reduce the surface of BC breaks whenever new keywords are introduced
  - Avoid restricting userland APIs. Dispensing the need for hacks like unecessary magic method calls, prefixed identifiers or the usage of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus|thesaurus]] to avoid naming conflicts.

This is a list of currently **globally** reserved words that will become **semi-reserved** in case proposed change gets approved:

  callable  class  trait  extends  implements  static  abstract  final  public  protected  private  const
  enddeclare  endfor  endforeach  endif  endwhile  and  global  goto  instanceof  insteadof  interface
  namespace  new  or  xor  try  use  var  exit  list  clone  include  include_once  throw  array
  print  echo  require  require_once  return  else  elseif  default  break  continue  switch  yield
  function  if  endswitch  finally  for  foreach  declare  case  do  while  as  catch  die  self

==== Limitations ====

On purporse, it's still forbidden to define ''class|object'' constants and methods named as:

  * ''public''
  * ''protected''
  * ''private''
  * ''abstract''
  * ''final''
  * ''static''

So the following code would still be invalid:

<code php>
class Foo {
  const public|protected|private|static|abstract|final|class = 'foo'; // Fatal error
  function public|protected|private|static|abstract|final(){} // Fatal error
}

// Fatal error: Cannot decalre a class const named as %d as it is reserved in %s on line %d
// Fatal error: Cannot declare a class method named as %d as it is reserved in %s on line %d
</code>

On purporse, it's still forbidden to define a **class constant** named as ''class'' because of the class name resolution operator ''::class'':

<code php>
class Foo {
  const class = 'Foo'; // Fatal error
}

// Fatal error: Cannot redefine class constant Foo::CLASS as it is reserved in %s on line %d
</code>

''class|object'' properties **can** have any name because PHP has sigils and code like the followiing has always been allowed:

<code php>
class Foo {
  public $list = 'list';
}

(new Foo)->list;
</code>

In practice, it means that we would drop from **64** to only **6** **globally** reserved words.

===== Practical Examples =====

Some practical examples related to the impact this RFC could have on user space code: 

The proposed change, if approved, gives more freedom to userland fluent interfaces or DSL like APIs.

<code php>
// the following example works with patch
// but currently fails because 'for', 'and', 'or', 'list' are globally reserved words:

$projects =
    Finder::for('project')
        ->where('name')->like('%secret%')
        ->and('priority', '>', 9)
        ->or('code')->in(['4', '5', '7'])
        ->and()->not('created_at')->between([$time1, $time2])
        ->list($limit, $offset);
</code>

<code php>
// the following example works with the patch
// but currently fails because 'foreach', 'list' and 'new' are globally reserved words:

class Collection extends \ArrayAccess, \Countable, \IteratorAggregate {

    public function forEach(callable $callback) {
        //...
    }

    public function list() {
        //...
    }

    public static function new(array $itens) {
        return new self($itens);
    }
}

Collection::new(['foo', 'bar'])->forEach(function($index, $item){
  /* callback */
})->list();
</code>

Globally reserved words end up limiting userland implementations on being the most expressive and semantic as possible:

<code php>
// the following example works with the patch
// but currently fails because 'include' is a globally reserved word:

class View {
    public function include(View $view) {
        //...
    }
}

$viewA = new View('a.view');
$viewA->include(new View('b.view'));
</code>

Sometimes there is simply no better name for a class constant. One might want to define an HTTP agent class and would like to have some HTTP status constants:

<code php>
class HTTP {
    const CONTINUE = 100; // works with patch
                          // but currently fails because 'continue' is a globally reserved word
    const SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS = 101;
    /* ... */
}
</code>

===== Impact On Other RFCs =====

Some RFCs are proposing to reserve new keywords in order to add features or reserve typehints names:

  * https://wiki.php.net/rfc/in_operator
  * https://wiki.php.net/rfc/reserve_more_types_in_php_7
  * https://wiki.php.net/rfc/reserve_even_more_types_in_php_7

With the approval of the current RFC, BC breaks surface would be much smaller in such cases.

One notable example is the **in** operator RFC. Without a context sensitive lexer, proposed here, the new operator would create a BC break on **Doctrine** library and pretty much many other SQL writers or ORMs out there:

https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/master/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Query/Expr.php#L443

===== Implementation Details =====

The lexer now keeps track of the context needed to have unreserved words on OO scope and makes use of a minimal amount of RE2C lookahead capabilities when disambiguation becomes inevitable.

For instance, the lexing rules to disambiguate ''::class'' (class name resolution operator) from a ''class constant'' or ''static method'' access is:

<code c++>
<ST_IN_SCRIPTING>"::"/{OPTIONAL_WHITESPACE}"class" {
  return T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM;
}

<ST_IN_SCRIPTING>"::"/{OPTIONAL_WHITESPACE}("$"|{LABEL}){OPTIONAL_WHITESPACE}"("? {
  yy_push_state(ST_LOOKING_FOR_SEMI_RESERVED_NAME);
  return T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM;
}
</code>

A few additional compile time check were created:

<code c>
if(ZEND_NOT_RESERVED != zend_check_reserved_method_name(decl->name)) {
  zend_error_noreturn(E_COMPILE_ERROR,
    "Cannot use '%s' as class method name as it is reserved", decl->name->val);
}
</code>

Current proposed patch:

  * Doesn't require ''lexical feedback'' (passing information from parser to lexer)
  * Keeps ext tokenizer functional
  * Introduces no maintenance issues
  * Has no performance impact
  * Introduces a minimal amount of changes on lexer

=> Many experiments with parsing were done before the current proposed patch which involves only lexing changes. But turns out the patches involving parsing had too many disadvantages and maintence issues.\\

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This is proposed for the next PHP x, which at the time of this writing would be PHP 7.

===== References =====

This is the previous rejected RFC that attempted to remove reserved words on all contexts: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/keywords_as_identifiers.

===== Rejected Features =====

None so far.

===== Changelog =====
  * 0.1: Initial draft with support for class, interfaces and trait members
  * 0.2: Additional support to namespaces, classes, interafces and traits names
  * 0.3: Oops. Add forgotten support for typehints
  * 0.4: Reverts to 0.1 feature set because class name support created undesired situations regarding the future addition of a future short lambda syntax and possibly block other language changes.
