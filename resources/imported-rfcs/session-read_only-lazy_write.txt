====== PHP RFC: Sessions: Improve original RFC about lazy_write ======

This is a proposal to make an update, or override a decision taken in the [[rfc:session-lock-ini]] RFC. Not in the sense of rejecting the RFC, but rather redesign the already accepted solution, namely the 'lazy_write' option passed to session_start().

The [[rfc:session-lock-ini]] has IMHO not been handled or thought out properly. What ended up as accepted from it is mostly unrelated to what it was originally all about (locking options). It (the RFC description) lacks a lot of information and implementation details, that are otherwise part of the patch (but not obvious).
This has made it possible for such details to either be overlooked completely or to not receive the deserved attention for something as critical as Sessions.

I feel that there's room for improvement in regards to backwards and forward compatibility, as well as an overall better API design. This is an attempt to make those improvements before there's no coming back from what I believe to be flaws in the initial design.

===== Introduction =====

//Note: Previously, here was a description of the issues related to the 'read_only' option, which was later renamed to 'read_and_close', effectively solving the problem.//

**lazy_write**

The issues with this option are non-obvious, diverse and are mostly related to userland session handlers.
Below is the description of how it works, that was missing from the original RFC, and is only evident by the patch and the author's comments during the discussion of this RFC.

//Note: PS_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP() is updateTimestamp() in userland, but it was previously called PS_UPDATE_FUNC() (or update()). It was changed for a more descriptive name.//

  * When ''$_SESSION'' is not changed: call ''PS_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP_FUNC()'' instead of ''PS_WRITE_FUNC()''.
  * ''PS_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP_FUNC()'' only changes the "last modified" timestamp (or a similar timestamp, depending on the storage in use) instead of re-writing all of the data. This is the performance improvement.
  * Userland session handlers can use ''updateTimestamp()'' to replicate ''PS_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP_FUNC()''.
  * ''updateTimestamp()'' is NOT added to the ''SessionHandler'' class to maintain BC.
    * This means that userland session handlers extending ''SessionHandler'' can't call ''parent::updateTimestamp()''.
    * It is made that way because the internal handler that ''SessionHandler'' wraps, may or may not have ''PS_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP_FUNC()'' (PECL extensions) and this is not detectable at runtime.
  * ''updateTimestamp()'' is NOT added to ''SessionHandlerInterface'' (to maintain BC), but is added to a new interface called ''SessionUpdateTimestampInterface''.
    * This is because of internal implementation details that were originally designed to just register all of the methods from ''SessionHandlerInterface'', so now you have to use //some// interface to add new methods.
  * If there's a userland session handler in use:
    * If the handler doesn't have ''updateTimestamp()'' - call ''write()'' to maintain BC.
    * If the handler has updateTimestamp() - call it.
       * As listed above, a class extending ''SessionHandler'' can NOT call ''parent::updateTimestamp()''. It has to call parent::write() to "extend" the internal handler.

And now, the problems with it:

1. You can't call parent::updateTimestamp().

The SessionHandler class was //made// to expose the internal implementation. To put emphasis on the problem, the following combination beats the whole purpose of having the SessionHandler class:

  * PHP will call SessionHandler::updateTimestamp(), if you have it.
  * You can't call parent::updateTimestamp() from it.

This is an unnecessary limitation, given that only a few PECL extensions wouldn't support the feature, which is a new one and this is not a BC concern.

2. There is little reason for the //option// (not the feature) to exist in the first place.

It is mostly a performance improvement instead of a //functional// change. It is somewhat a behavioral change, but still a performance improvement and designed in a way that doesn't break existing applications.

Performance improvements should not be optional, unless they break backwards compatibility and this one is designed to avoid that. Therefore, it should not be optional.

3. No API to detect the option, at all.

'lazy_write' was originally proposed as an INI setting. However, it was reduced to being just a session_start() option because of feedback on the RFC discussion stating that "users don't like INI settings", or that there are too many INIs already. This is a valid point, but it ignores the fact that INI settings do have a purpose and are in some cases a necessity. For 'lazy_write' to be optional and with no other API available, ini_get() would've been a way for userland code to detect it. Furthermore, with session_start() also accepting existing session.* INI settings, this is yet another inconsistency.

Also, the whole feature was inspired by a [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=17860|feature request]] for an API to detect if $_SESSION has been changed or not.

===== Proposal =====

A combination of multiple (but not all) of the following:

==== Merge updateTimestamp() into write() ====

SessionHandler::write() should decide whether all data should be written or just the timestamp updated.

This solves all problems:

  * Not adding an unnecessary interface (SessionUpdateTimestampInterface).
  * Maintaining backwards compatibility, even with PECL extensions.
  * Enabling userland code to call parent::methodName().
  * No API changes, at all.

Another argument in favor of this solution is that currently, this is the only design allowing userland implementations of 'lazy_write' behavior.

==== Add SessionHandler::updateTimestamp(), when available ====

updateTimestamp() can be added to SessionHandler at instantiation time, depending on whether the current session.save_handler supports it. This is of course an alternative to moving its logic to write().

It might not be convenient for some session modules to have the method and others not, but users are in general careful with PECL extensions and of course, it should be properly documented. Anybody could write a PHP extension that provides a session handler that even breaks current functionality - there's no guarantee on that.
What can be done however, is to not put unnecessary limits because of third-party extensions. It's a good enough trade-off, IMO.

And this wouldn't be a precedent, many MySQLi functions only exist if mysqlnd support is present.

==== Add API exposing $_SESSION changes status ====

This is what was originally asked for via feature request [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=17860|#17860]] and would be useful even without 'lazy_write', allowing users to make the performance improvement on their own.

It can be a "magic constant" like the currently existing 'SID'.
It can be a function, i.e. session_is_changed().
It can be a property or a method of the SessionHandler class.

Either of the above would be sufficient, it doesn't matter, just as long as the user has a way of accessing that state.

==== Always do "lazy writes" ====

There's no reason for this feature to be optional, as explained above - it is a performance improvement and the patch already calls write() if updateTimestamp() doesn't exist. If this RFC is accepted, it would make even less sense to keep it optional.
Worst thing that could happen is to fallback to the old behavior where session data is written at all times.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None, the aim is to make the already accepted solution even easier to handle in regards to older versions, given that it is accepted for PHP 5.6.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 5.6

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

ext/session and all extensions providing a session handler.

===== php.ini Defaults =====

None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Various combinations of the [[rfc:session-read_only-lazy_write#proposal]] sections.

Should require 50% + 1 votes.

===== Patches and Tests =====

No patch is available at this time, I'll be looking for a volunteer with Yasuo Oghaki being a likely candidate.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== Rejected Features =====

  * Making 'read_only' a separate function.

Almost nobody recognized this as something important and anyway the main issue here was the highly misleading name that 'read_only' is for what it does. Based on discission and an earlier version of this RFC, the patch for [[rfc:session-lock-ini]] has been altered to use the 'read_and_close' name, which is fine.
