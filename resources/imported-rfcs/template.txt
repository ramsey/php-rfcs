This is a suggested template for PHP Request for Comments (RFCs). Change this template to suit your RFC.  Not all RFCs need to be tightly specified.  Not all RFCs need all the sections below.

You RFC should move PHP forward. As [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66065|said by Derick Rethans]] "Consider only features which have significant traction to a
large chunk of our userbase, and not something that could be useful in some
extremely specialized edge cases [...] Make sure you think about the full context, the huge audience out there, the consequences of  making the learning curve steeper with
every new feature, and the scope of the goodness that those new features bring."
===== Introduction =====

The elevator pitch for the RFC.

===== Proposal =====

All the features and examples of the proposal.

To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain hows the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
for inclusion in one of the world's most popular programming languages.

Remember that the RFC contents should be easily reusable in the PHP Documentation.
===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

List the proposed PHP versions that the feature will be included in.  Use relative versions such as "next PHP 5.x" or "next PHP 5.x.y".

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

  * php.ini-production values

===== Open Issues =====

Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

===== Patches and Tests =====

Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

===== References =====

Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====
