===== Introduction =====
Namespace visibility modifiers, in one shape or another (or by other names), have been a topic of discussion in the PHP community for more than a decade (ever since the introduction of formal namespaces in PHP 5.4). Within the last 3 years, access modifiers for classes and class members has been partially realized through a proof-of-concept patch to support namespace-private classes.

A few years ago, a proof-of-concept implementation of namespace private classes was submitted to the project. The topic and implementation generated a lot of discussion and it felt like the room was ready to move forward. The implementation stalled after much progress and is currently blocked by namespaces existing only-during compile-time and not being available for run-time checks (to prevent unauthorized instantiation of classes).

The purpose of this RFC is to officially propose the idea of namespace visibility modifiers for classes, interfaces and traits in PHP; leveraging current internal data structures rather than requiring re-engineering of namespaces as a whole.

==== What does "visible" mean? ====
In this context, "visible" refers to the top-level visibility of a class, interface or trait and has NO implications on the visibility of it's members. Static access is always denied for non-visible classes and instance access is controlled by the visibility of class members; regardless of top-level visibility.

Static access includes things like:

  * Instantiating or extending a class
  * Implementing or extending an interface
  * Using a trait
  * Calling static methods of a class
  * Reading or writing to static properties of a class

Instance access includes things like:

  * Calling an instance method
  * Reading or writing instance properties of a class
  * Cloning an object (it's the same as calling a instance method, in PHP)

Top-level visibility primarily controls static access to a class. It does not affect access to instances of a class or its members. That is left to the visibility declarations of those members.

A reasonable metaphor might be that if you can't **see** a class, then you can't instantiate or extend it. However, your visibility of a class has no effect on your visibility of an **object** at runtime, so your ability to work with an object from a ''private'' class is unhindered.

==== Why? ====
Namespace visibility modifiers afford library developers the ability to control instantiation of classes, interfaces and traits outside the library namespace. Many of the most popular frameworks / libraries in PHP currently rely on a conventional ''@internal'' docblock to distinguish classes that end-users should not be using and there is some IDE support for //warning// users when they are using an internal class. There is currently not a reasonable way for developers to enforce the notion that a class, interface or trait is for "internal use only".

In other languages that have namespace-like features, visibility modifiers (in one way or another) are available for use. PHP is not other languages, certainly. However, the problem of visibility control is common in many object-oriented languages. C# classes are ''internal'', by default (meaning the class can be accessed by any code in the same "assembly"). Classes in C# can be declared ''public'', allowing them to be instatiated in any "assembly". Java, similarly, has a concept of "package-private" or ''public'' classes. Classes in Java are "package-private", by default; meaning that the class is only visible within its "package" (or namespace). ''public'' classes are visible everywhere.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC adds support for namespace visibility modifiers to class, interface and trait declarations. These visibility modifiers govern where each can be statically accessed (i.e. instantiated, implemented or ''use''-ed), but have no effect on member visibility during runtime.

The following example illustrates the basic syntax for classes: 

<code php>
namespace Example {
    public class A 
    {
       private $property;
    }

    protected class B
    {
       public $property;
    }

    private class C
    {
       protected $property;
    }
}

namespace OtherVendor {
    public class Factory
    {
        public function A()
        {
            return new \Example\A();  // Allowed by public
        }

        public function B()
        {
            return new \Example\B();  // Not allowed because 
                                       // namespace is not shared
        }

        public function C()
        {
            return new \Example\C();  // Not allowed because
                                       // not from same namespace
        }
    }
}
</code>

==== Supported Modifiers ====
''public'', ''protected'' and ''private'' visibility modifiers are added for top-level class, interface and trait declarations:

  - Public declarations will be visible from anywhere, which is the current behaviour. If no modifier is supplied, public shall be the default to maintain backwards compatibility with this behaviour.
  - Protected declarations will be visible from anywhere that *shares* a higher-level namespace with the target of the visibility modifier. For example, ``Vendor\SampleClass` and `Vendor\Deeper\SampleClass` share `Vendor`.
  - Private declarations will only be visible from the namespace in which they are declared.

Classes, interfaces and traits may only have a single modifier. Use of multiple modifiers will result in a Fatal Error.

<code php>
private public class Example     
{
    // ILLEGAL
}

private class LegalExample       
{
    // legal
}
</code>

==== Instantiation of Classes ====
Namespace visibility can be used to control where a class is allowed to be instantiated from. This is an important driver for the use-cases supported by this RFC. Package maintainers can use this feature to enforce that classes that are "internal" implementation details are not abused outside their namespace.  

Class declarations may be marked ''public'', ''protected'' or ''private''. If no modifier is specified, the default visibility is ''public''. In other languages, the default would be "package-private" (or approximately ''protected'', as this RFC defines it). In PHP, this would be a massive backwards incompatibility that is not worth blocking the added value presented by namespace visibility.

<code php>
namespace Example {
    // May be instantiated from anywhere.
    public class PublicClass {}

    // May only be instantiated from a shared namespace.
    protected class ProtectedClass {}

    // May only be instantiated from classes in \Example.
    private class PrivateClass {}
}
</code>

There is nothing different about how visibility is enforced when instantiating a class inside a closure, a function, a class method or anywhere else. 

<code php>
namespace Example\Nested {
    // May be instantiated because namespace is shared.
    $success = new \Example\ProtectedClass();

    // Fails because not same namespace.
    $fail = new \Example\PrivateClass();

    // Fails because not same namespace.
    function factory() {
       return new \Example\PrivateClass();
    }
    factory();

    // Fails because not same namespace.
    $object = function () {
      return new \Example\PrivateClass();
    }
    $object();

    // Runtime shenanigans will not work around
    // namespace visibility.
    $classString = "\Example\PrivateClass";
    $fail = new $classString();
}
</code>

Because ''\Example\Nested'' shares a parent-namespace with ''\Example\ProtectedClass'', it can instantiate the class through its ''protected'' namespace visibility. Instantiation of classes within functions and closures behaves no different than if executed at the root of the namespace. All that matters is the namespace that the code is executing *from* compared to the *target class* namespace and modifier.

<code php>
namespace SomeOtherVendor {
    class Factory {
        // Legal to declare, but illegal at runtime.
        public function make() {
            return new \Example\PrivateClass();
        }
    }

    new \Example\ProtectedClass();            // ILLEGAL
    (new Factory())->make();                  // ILLEGAL

    new \Example\PublicClass();               // legal
}
</code>

In another namespace, instantiation of ''private'' classes is illegal. Instantiation of ''protected'' classes that do not share a namespace parent is also illegal. In the above example, the only legal instantiation is of a ''public'' class.

<code php>
namespace {
    new \Example\ProtectedClass();            // ILLEGAL
    new \Example\PrivateClass();              // ILLEGAL

    new \Example\PublicClass();               // legal
    new \SomeOtherVendor\Factory()            // legal
}
</code>

Namespace visibility is enforced at the global space as well. Enforcement of visibility does not change if the calling scope does not have a named namespace (or any namespace at all). The rules for enforcement still apply. Developers can instantiate ''public'' classes and will be disallowed from instantiating ''protected'' or ''private'' classes by virtue that there is no shared namespace (in the ''protected'' case) and the absence of namespace is, by definition, NOT the same namespace.

==== Interfaces ====
Interface declarations may be marked ''public'', ''protected'' or ''private''. If no modifier is specified, the default visibility is ''public''.

<code php>
namespace Example {
    // May be implemented in any namespace.
    public interface PublicInterface {}

    // Equivalent to public.
    interface PublicInterface {}

    // May only be implemented in a shared namespace.
    protected interface ProtectedInterface {}

    // May only be implemented by classes in \Example.
    private interface PrivateInterface {}
}
</code>

<code php>
namespace Example\Nested {
    // Always works because interface is public.
    class SuccessfulImplementation implements \Example\PublicInterface
    {
        /* ... */
    }

    // May implement interface because namespace is shared.
    class SuccessfulImplementation implements \Example\ProtectedInterface
    {
        /* ... */
    }

    // Fails because not same namespace.
    class FailingImplementation implements \Example\PrivateInterface
    {
        /* ... */
    }
}
</code>

''\Example\Nested'' shares a namespace with the declared interfaces in ''\Example''. Because of this, ''SuccessfulImplementation'' may implement the ''protected'' interface in ''\Example''. However, because ''FailingImplementation'' is not in the exact same namespace, it is restricted from implementing the ''private'' interface in the ''\Example'' namespace.

<code php>
namespace SomeOtherVendor {
    class VendorImplementation implements \Example\PublicInterface
    {
        // legal
    }

    class FailedImplementation implements \Example\ProtectedInterface
    {
        // ILLEGAL
    }

    class FailedImplementation implements \Example\PrivateInterface
    {
        // ILLEGAL
    }
}
</code>

In a completely separate space that shares no common namespace with ''\Example'', the only legal implementation is of the ''public'' interface from ''\Example''. All other implementations are illegal because they either don't share a namespace (in the ''protected'' case) or are not the *same* namespace (in the ''private'' case).

<code php>
namespace {
    class GlobalImplementation implements \Example\PublicInterface
    {
        // legal
    }

    class FailedImplementation implements \Example\ProtectedInterface
    {
        // ILLEGAL
    }

    class FailedImplementation implements \Example\PrivateInterface
    {
        // ILLEGAL
    }
}
</code>

Likewise, the only legal implementation in the global space is of ''\Example\PublicInterface''.

==== Traits ====
Trait declarations may be marked ''public'', ''protected'' or ''private''. If no modifier is specified, the default visibility is ''public''.

<code php>
namespace Example {
    // May be used by classes in any namespace.
    public trait PublicTrait {}

    // Equivalent to public.
    trait PublicTrait {}

    // May only be used by classes in a shared namespace.
    protected trait ProtectedTrait {}

    // May only be used by classes in \Example.
    private trait PrivateTrait {}
}
</code>

<code php>
namespace Example\Nested {
    class UseTheTraits
    {
        use \Example\PublicTrait;       // legal
        use \Example\ProtectedTrait;    // legal
        use \Example\PrivateTrait;      // ILLEGAL
    }
}
</code>

<code php>
namespace SomeOtherVendor {
    class UseTheTraits
    {
        use \Example\PublicTrait;       // legal
        use \Example\ProtectedTrait;    // ILLEGAL
        use \Example\PrivateTrait;      // ILLEGAL
    }
}
</code>

<code php>
namespace {
    class UseTheTraits
    {
        use \Example\PublicTrait;       // legal
        use \Example\ProtectedTrait;    // ILLEGAL
        use \Example\PrivateTrait;      // ILLEGAL
    }
}
</code>

==== Inheritance ====
Namespace visibility also controls access to where a class or interface can be extended. 

<code php>
namespace Example {
    // Extendable from any namespace.
    public abstract class PublicClass {}

    // Only extendable from namespaces shared by \Example
    protected class ProtectedClass {}

    // Can only be subclassed within the \Example namespace.
    private class PrivateClass {}

    // Declared without modifier, this interface
    // can be implemented or extended in any namespace.
    interface PublicInterface {}

    // Can only be implemented or extended in the 
    // \Example namespace.
    private interface PrivateInterface {}
}
</code>

<code php>
namespace Example\Shared {
    class SomeImplementation implements PrivateInterface 
    {
        // ILLEGAL
    }

    private class PrivateClass extends ProtectedClass 
    {
        // legal
    }
}
</code>

''SomeImplementation'' is not allowed to implement ''PrivateInterface'' because they are not in the same namespace. ''PrivateClass'' can extend ''ProtectedClass'' because they share a higher-level namespace.

<code php>
namespace {
    class InvalidChildClass extends \Example\PrivateClass {}            // ILLEGAL
    class InvalidImplementation implements \Example\PrivateInterface    // ILLEGAL

    protected class ProtectedClass extends PublicClass {}               // legal
    class AnotherImplementation implements \Example\PublicInterface {}  // legal
}
</code>

Nothing changes about how these rules are applied in the global space. The only legal sub-classing or implementations are of public classes and interfaces.

==== Cloning ====
Cloning of objects at runtime is unaffected by namespace visibility as cloning is considered to be an instance access concern, not much different from property or method access. A private class declared in one namespace can be freely cloned in another namespace without issue.

Developers who wish to prevent this behaviour may override ''__clone()'' and throw an exception if they choose to.

<code php>
namespace A {
    private class PrivateClass
    {
    }

    $original = new PrivateClass();

    var_dump($original);            // object(A\PrivateClass)#1 (0) {}
}

namespace {
    $cloned = clone $original;

    var_dump($cloned);              // object(A\PrivateClass)#2 (0) {}
}
</code>

==== Reflection API ====
Developers can reflect on any class, interface or trait, regardless of visibility. Four new methods are added to ''ReflectionClass'':

- ''ReflectionClass::isPublic'' - Checks if the method is public. 
- ''ReflectionClass::isProtected'' - Checks if the method is protected. 
- ''ReflectionClass::isPrivate'' - Checks if the method is private. 
- ''ReflectionClass::setAccessible'' - Set method accessibility. 

<code php>
namespace Example {
    public class PublicClass {}
    private class PrivateClass {}
    protected interface ProtectedInterface {}
    private trait PrivateTrait {}
}

namespace {
    $a = new ReflectionClass('Example\PublicClass');

    $a->isPublic();     // true
    $a->isPrivate();    // false

    $b = new ReflectionClass('Example\PrivateClass');

    $b->isProtected();  // false
    $b->isPrivate();    // true

    $c = new ReflectionClass('Example\ProtectedInterface');

    $c->isInterface();  // true
    $c->isProtected();  // true
    $c->isPrivate();    // false

    $d = new ReflectionClass('Example\PrivateTrait');

    $d->isTrait();      // true
    $d->isPrivate();    // true
    $d->isPublic();     // false

    // Creating a new instance of a private class is disallowed
    // unless you ReflectionClass::setAccessible(true)
    $fail = $b->newInstance();

    $b->setAccessible(true);
    $success = $b->newInstance();   // legal
}
</code>

===== Implementation Details =====
TBD.

===== Open Questions =====
1. What operations should be fatal errors at compile time versus run time? For example, declaring a closure that instantiates a private class outside its namespace; when should this fail? As soon as declared or as soon as executed?

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There are no backwards incompatible changes in this RFC. In many languages that support "namespace visibility", the default visibility is ''private''. To maintain backwards compatibility, the default visibility proposed by this RFC is ''public''. This RFC has no impact on current PHP codebases. 

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Proposed PHP version depends on whether or not there will be a PHP 7.4 before PHP 8.0. This RFC prefers the earlier of the two. If there is a PHP 7.4, this RFC targets that. Otherwise, it targets PHP 8.0.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Opcache ====
Someone more familiar with the Opcache components will need to review the implementation patch for this RFC to apply optimization and sanity check things.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
This RFC does not impact developers in any way. Current codebases can remain as-is and experience no change in behaviour. This is because non-modified classes, interfaces and traits are ''public'', by default.

===== Future Scope =====
TBD.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Since this is a substantial language change, a 2/3rds majority is required.

===== Patches and Tests =====
TBD.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged into
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
