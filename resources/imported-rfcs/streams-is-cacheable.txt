===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes a generic way for opcode caches to determine if a given URI is
cacheable or not.

===== Proposal =====

When stream wrappers were introduced in PHP, their relationship with opcode
caches was not a problem, as they were mostly used to access remote data. The
need for a better interaction arose with package systems, like phar and phk, as
these stream wrappers manage a virtual PHP source tree through stream URIs. If
the scripts provided by such a system cannot be opcode-cached, the system looses a great
part of its value.

Historically, the issue was addressed using different workarounds : either every
URI is considered as opcode-cacheable (APC), whatever wrapper it is coming from, or
a list of 'cacheable' protocols is declared explicitely in the cache code. For
instance, opcache
is using the second solution : 'file' and 'phar' are explicitely
declared as the only 'cacheable' stream wrappers. This is a
quick-and-dirty workaround and there is real need for a reliable and generic
way of determining whether an URI is cacheable.

What I am proposing :

* An element named 'stream_is_cacheable' is added at the end of the php_stream_wrapper_ops
structure. This is an optional pointer to a function able to determine if
a given URI is cacheable or not. This function receives an URI, an options
bitfield, and an optional context. It returns a value different of 0 if the
URI is cacheable. If the 'stream_is_cacheable' element is null, every URI for this wrapper
are considered as non-cacheable.

* A new C function named php_stream_is_cacheable(const char *path, int options, php_stream_context *context)
is defined. It determines the right wrapper from the path it receives and
forwards the request to the corresponding stream_is_cacheable() function, if it
exists. If the stream_is_cacheable() element is not defined, 0 is returned.

* Userspace stream wrappers can define a method named is_cacheable(path [,options]).
This method determines if the input path is cacheable and returns true or false.
If the method is not defined, every path for this wrapper are non-cacheable.

* For completeness, a new PHP function named file_is_cacheable(path [, options [, context]])
is defined. It allows to determine from a PHP script whether a path is cacheable.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====

None

==== To Existing Extensions ====

Phar needs to implement an is_cacheable() function, returning always 1.

The same for the plain files wrapper.

==== To Opcache ====

Opcode caches must implement the following logic :

If the received path is a 'stream' path, call php_stream_is_cacheable(path, 0, NULL).

If the returned value is non null, the path is cacheable. If it is null, the path is not cacheable.

==== New Constants ====

None

===== Open Issues =====

None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

Stream wrappers that don't require their scripts to be cacheable are not modified
in any way.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Required majority: 50%+1

===== Patches and Tests =====

This PR includes every modification described in this RFC, including phar and
plain files is_cacheable() handler. It also contains tests.

PHP documentation additions (file_is_cacheable(), streamWrapper::is_cacheable())
not written yet.
