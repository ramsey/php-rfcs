====== PHP RFC: Easy User-land CSPRNG ======
  * Version: 0.3
  * Date: 2015-02-20
  * Author: Sammy Kaye Powers <me@sammyk.me> & Leigh <leigh@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/easy_userland_csprng


===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes adding a user-land API for an easy to use and reliable [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator|CSPRNG]] in PHP.

==== The Problem ====
By default PHP does not provide an easy mechanism for accessing cryptographically strong random numbers in user-land. Users have a few options like ''openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()'', ''mcrypt_create_iv()'' or directly opening ''/dev/*random'' devices to obtain high quality pseudo-random bytes, but unfortunately system support for these functions and extensions varies and each come with their own set of problems

  * ''mcrypt_create_iv()'' has no dependency on [[http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/|MCrypt lib]]. Users are forced to include an entire library for no reason.
  * ''openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()'' is provided by the [[https://www.openssl.org/|OpenSSL lib]]. This function comes with a ''$crypto_strong'' the meaning of which may just confuse users.
  * Falling back to ''/dev/urandom'' is OS-specific and can fail when ''open_basedir'' is set.

See the [[https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk-v4/tree/master/src/Facebook/PseudoRandomString|Facebook PHP SDK's implementation of a CSPRNG]] in PHP to understand how much code is needed in user-land to simply generate cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes.

In addition users may attempt to generate their own streams of random bytes relying on ''rand()'' or ''mt_rand()'', and this is something we absolutely want to avoid.

===== Proposal =====
There should be a user-land API to easily return an arbitrary length of cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes directly and work on any supported server configuration or OS.

The initial proposal is to add **two** user-land functions that return the bytes as binary and integer.

Signatures:
<code>
random_bytes(int length);
random_int([int min = ~PHP_INT_MAX [, int max = PHP_INT_MAX]]);
</code>

Examples:
<code php>
$randomStr = random_bytes($length = 16);

$randomInt = random_int($min = 0, $max = 127);
</code>

The sources of random used are as follows:
  * On windows ''CryptGenRandom'' is used exclusively
  * ''arc4random_buf()'' is used if present for fd-less random
  * ''/dev/arandom'' is used where available
  * ''/dev/urandom'' is used where none of the above is available

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There would be no BC breaks.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
This RFC should not impact the SAPI's.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No existing extensions are affected.

==== To Opcache ====
Opcache is unaffected.

==== New Constants ====
There would be no new constants.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
There would be no new php.ini defaults.

===== Open Issues =====
  * Nothing yet

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
This change does not affect any of the existing ''rand()'' or ''mt_rand()'' functionality.

===== Future Scope =====
The concepts from the RFC could be used to:

   * Deprecate ''mcrypt_create_iv()''
   * Improve ''session_id'' randomness generation
   * Detect LibreSSL portable for arc4random() on Linux
   * Improve fd-less random for chroot environments with our own arc4random and the linux ''getrandom'' syscall
   * Add complimentary easy-use and secure by default cryptography functions
