====== PHP RFC: Switch from json extension to jsonc ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2013-08-25
  * Author: Remi Collet <remi@php.net>
  * Status: Draft (or Under Discussion or Accepted or Declined)
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/free-json-parser

===== Introduction =====

Since PHP 5.2.0, JSON format support is provided by ext/json.

During a code license review, Debian project have discovered a issue with the code used, reported as [[https://bugs.php.net/63520|Bug #63520]].

Effectively, code from json.org is not free, as its License includes a restriction to freedom 0 (run the program for any purpose) : "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil".  The discussion about this state is out of the scope of this RFC.

The encoder code is free since PHP 5.4.10 ([[https://bugs.php.net/id=63588|Bug #63588]])

===== Proposal =====

The **jsonc** extension, currently available from PECL site is designed to be a dropin alternative (user API and internal ABI for other extensions).
  * Same **encoder** than PHP 5.5
  * **Parser** provided by the [[https://github.com/json-c/json-c|json-c]] library (License MIT). Build can use the system library (--with-libjson) or the bundled copy (currently version 0.11 + some patches waiting for upstream review)

As the new parser is an incremental one, the new **JsonIncrementalParser** class expose this feature


<code>
$parser = new JsonIncrementalParser();
$fic = fopen("somefile.json", "r");
do {
    $buf = fgets($fic);
    $ret = $parser->parse($buf);
} while ($buf && ($ret==JsonIncrementalParser::JSON_PARSER_CONTINUE));
$result = $parser->get();
</code>

Or, allow to parse a file without having to load it into memory:
<code>
$parser = new JsonIncrementalParser();
$ret = $parser->parseFile("somefile.json");
$result = $parser->get();
</code>

The json-c parser provides 2 strictness mode:
  * strict mode, used by default (for compatibility with previous implementation)
  * standard mode, available using the JSON_PARSER_NOTSTRICT option

Having a **not-strict parser** could be usefull for reading configuration from manually edited file, such as:
<code>
/*
Foo configuration file
*/
{
    "temp": "/tmp", // directory
    "debug": true,  // boolean
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Partial implementation of big integers parsing (and of JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING option). This will only work in a 32bits build for value fitting in a 64bits integer (not managed by PHP, so returned as string or float). Notice: no //natural// encoder will generate such data.

As the new parser implement different error codes, parser error is always returned by **json_last_error()** as JSON_ERROR_SYNTAX (JSON_ERROR_STATE_MISMATCH and JSON_ERROR_CTRL_CHAR are kept for compatibility but never used).

**json_last_error_msg()** returns error string from the json-c library.


===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 5.6

Notice **pecl/jsonc** extension is already adopted by various Linux distributions which cannot provide non-free code.

  * **Debian** since PHP 5.5 / Jessie
  * **Fedora** since PHP 5.5 / Fedora 19
  * **Mageia** since PHP 5.5
  * **Ubuntu** since PHP 5.5 / Saucy

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

All

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

  * replace json extension by jsonc (of course, renamed to json)

===== New Constants =====

JSON_PARSER_NOTSTRICT which allow to reduce parser strictness
  * comment are allowed
  * trailing char after data are ignored
  * trailing coma in list are ignored
  * etc

JSON_C_BUNDLED boolean, true if bundled json-c library is used, false if system one

JSON_C_VERSION version of the json-c library

===== Open Issues =====

None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

No change in PHP engine.
No change for other extension.

===== Future Scope =====

Speed improvment.


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

  * Yes (switch from json to jsonc in php 5.6)
  * No (keep using non-free stuff in php)

===== Patches and Tests =====

Current sources: [[https://github.com/remicollet/pecl-json-c]]

Notice : the test suite from the original json extension is kept. New features have new tests.
