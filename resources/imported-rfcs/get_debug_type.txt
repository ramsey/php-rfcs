===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes to add a new function get_debug_type that will return the given type of a variable.

This function would differ from gettype in that it would return native type names, e.g. "int" rather than "integer" and would automatically resolve class names.

0 => int
0.1 => float
true => bool
false => bool
"hello" => string
[] => array
null => null
A class with name "Foo\Bar" => foo\bar
An anonymous class => class@anonymous
A resource => resource (xxx)
A closed resource => resource (closed)



===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8.0

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Yes / no vote on adding the new function.

Yes / no on resource names be resolved - Would appear as resource(resource_type).

(Optional) A vote on the name, if there is not a clear majority consensus during RFC discussion.
