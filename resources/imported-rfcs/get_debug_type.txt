===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes to add a new function get_debug_type that will return the given type of a variable.

This function would differ from gettype in that it would return native type names, e.g. "int" rather than "integer" and would automatically resolve class names. The following table shows what ''get_debug_type()'' returns for different values, and what ''gettype()'' returns for the same value (if it is different):

^ Value   ^ get_debug_type() ^ gettype() ^
| 0       | int | integer |
| 0.1     | float | double |
| true    | bool | boolean |
| false   | bool | boolean |
| "hello" | string | |
| []      | array  | |
| null    | null | NULL |
| A class with name "Foo\Bar" | Foo\Bar  | object |
| An anonymous class | class@anonymous   | object |
| A resource         | resource (xxx)    | resource |
| A closed resource  | resource (closed) | |

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8.0

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Yes / no vote on adding the new function.
