This RFC is to discuss comparison and conversion inconsistencies in PHP. 

===== Introduction =====

There are number of in comparison and conversion inconsistencies.

For example, 
  * https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53104 reports comparison inconsistency in min() function.

There are number issues of like this.

Purpose of this RFC is fix inconsistency where it's feasible, otherwise document then fully if it's not documented already.

===== Inconsistency =====
==== Conversion/comparison ====

Type juggling only works for INTEGER or HEX like strings.

=== HEX ===
Code
  var_dump(0x0A);
  var_dump("0x0A");
  var_dump((int)"0x0A");
  var_dump((float)"0x0A");
  var_dump(intval("0x0A"));
  var_dump(floatval("0x0A"));

Output
  int(10)
  string(4) "0x0A"
  int(0)
  float(0)
  int(0)
  float(0)

Code
  if (0x0A == '0x0A') {
    echo "0x0A == '0x0A'".PHP_EOL;
  }
  if (0x0A == "0x0A") {
    echo '0x0A == "0x0A"'.PHP_EOL;
  }

Output
  0x0A == '0x0A'
  0x0A == "0x0A"


=== Octal ===

Code
  var_dump(010);
  var_dump("010");
  var_dump((int)"010");
  var_dump((float)"010");
  var_dump(intval("010"));
  var_dump(floatval("010"));

Output
  int(8)
  string(3) "010"
  int(10)
  float(10)
  int(10)
  float(10)

CODE
  if (010 == '010') {
    echo "010 == '010'".PHP_EOL;
  }
  if (010 == "010") {
    echo '010 == "010"'.PHP_EOL;
  }

OUTPUT
  (NONE)


=== BINARY ===

Code
  var_dump(0b110);
  var_dump("0b110");
  var_dump((int)"0b110");
  var_dump((float)"0b110");
  var_dump(intval("0b110"));
  var_dump(floatval("0b110"));

Output
  int(6)
  string(5) "0b110"
  int(0)
  float(0)
  int(0)
  float(0)

CODE
  if (0b010 == '0b010') {
    echo "0b010 == '0b010'".PHP_EOL;
  }
  if (0b010 == "0b010") {
    echo '010 == "010"'.PHP_EOL;
  }

OUTPUT
  (NONE)

=== Array of Chars ===

Null string is not handled as ARRAY.

https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/463

Test script:
  $a = ''; // empty string
  $a[10] = 'a';
  echo $a; // "Array"
  
  $b = ' '; // non empty string
  $b[10] = 'b';
  echo $b; // "          b"

Expected result:
  "          a"
  "          b"

Actual result:
  "Array"
  "          b"

==== String Integer conversion ====

PHP converts "integer like string to integer".

  <?php
  
  // this is the problem, which we'd expect
  // to return false, but which returns true:
  echo (2 == '2b').'<br />';
  
  // this is probably what's happening:
  echo (2 == intval('2b')).'<br />';
  
  // this is what probably should happen:
  echo (strval(2) != '2b').'<br />';
  
  ?>

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=66211

Not only is this not a bug, it isn't even exceptional behavior on the
modern web. A user who find this behavior surprising is likely
inexperienced with MySQL -- clearly PHP's partner in server-side
ubiquity as part of the dominant *AMP stack -- which has the exact
same rules for auto-coercion of "numeroalphabetic" strings in a
comparison context.

In MySQL (all supported versions):

<code sql>
SELECT CASE WHEN '-45herearesomeletters' = -45 THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END
</code>

prints 'true'

There are other popular languages that follow the same
casting/coercion rule, though they do not automatically perform the
coercion during comparison. For example, JavaScript
parseInt('-45herearesomeletters') results in the integer -45. In
SQLite, the ubiquitous embedded SQL database, also CAST(
'-45herearesomeletters' AS SIGNED ) produces the integer -45.

The SQLite documentation explains the logic well: 

> When casting a TEXT value to INTEGER, the longest possible prefix of
> the value that can be interpreted as an integer number is extracted
> from the TEXT value and the remainder ignored. Any leading spaces in
> the TEXT value when converting from TEXT to INTEGER are ignored. If
> there is no prefix that can be interpreted as an integer number, the
> result of the conversion is 0. (http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#castexpr)

And this behavior is not considered particularly "distinctive". (http://sqlite.org/different.html)

Since the ubiquity of MySQL has been used to support the expectations
users should have of PHP, it's fair to note Oracle, SQL Server, and
PostgreSQL will not allow the above comparison to be performed: the
statement produces a fatal error. It's a runtime casting error: these
languages do not prohibit comparing values of different datatypes, as
long as the engine can cast the runtime contents of the value. Yet
such implementations, arguably, violate the "least astonishment"
concept, since a errant letter modifier like '1A' will cause a fatal
error where the expectation might be to either have a '1A' compare
equal to 1 (as in MySQL) or fail gracefully (as in SQLite). In this
respect, the SQLite behavior is more balanced than that of
Oracle/MSSQL/PGSQL, and PHP and MySQL's behavior is graceful,
generous, and reasonable.

With PHP and MySQL agreeing on this behavior, it is clear that
automatically coercing a "numeroalphabetic" string (for want of a
better term) to a number via truncation is common practice on the web,
even if it is news to the inexperienced user.

==== String decrements ====

String decrements is inconsistent

https://wiki.php.net/rfc/alpanumeric_decrement

==== NAN/INF of float ====

NAN/INF issue.

  $f = NAN;
  var_dump(++$f);                 // float NAN
  var_dump((float) NAN);   // float NAN
  var_dump((int) NAN);       // int -2147483648 -> what?
  var_dump((bool) NAN);   // bool true -> makes sense
  
  $f = INF;
  var_dump(++$f);                         // float INF
  var_dump((float) INF);             // float INF
  var_dump((int) INF);                 // int 0 -> what?
  var_dump((bool) INF);             // bool true -> so why int 0?
  var_dump((int) (bool) INF);   // int 1

E_WARNING for these invalid/unreliable operations might be better.
 
This could be mitigated by GMP float support.


==== Object Array conversion of numeric property/index ====

Object/Array cast looses accessibility of numeric property/element.

===== Function/Method =====

==== assert ====

assert() does not accept closure while it accepts functions.

<code>
php > function f() {return FALSE;}
php > assert(f());

Warning: assert(): Assertion failed in php shell code on line 1
php > assert(function() {return FALSE;});
</code>

https://wiki.php.net/rfc/expectations

==== base_convert ====

https://wiki.php.net/rfc/base-convert


==== is_numeric ====

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=66399



==== min ====

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53104

This is not a bug. If one of operand is BOOL(or NULL), both operands are converted to BOOL and evaluated as BOOL. It may be good idea that document this behavior in min() manual.

**Status**
Documented.

http://jp2.php.net/min


==== Return value of wrong internal function/method parameters ====

If not all, almost all functions return NULL when required function parameter is missing or wrong type. However, almost all functions return FALSE when they have errors.

The manual has document for this behavior
http://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.internal.php

  Note: If the parameters given to a function are not what it expects, such as passing an array 
  where a string is expected, the return value of the function is undefined. In this case it will 
  likely return NULL but this is just a convention, and cannot be relied upon.

This behavior could be cause of bug in scripts. For instance,

  if (FALSE === some_func($wrong_parameter)) {
     // Error happend!
  } else {
     // OK to go
  }

Users should not rely on return value as it may return NULL for wrong parameters. Users should rely on error/exception handler for such case as internal functions raise E_WARNING in this case. (If there are function that does not raise error, it is subject to be fixed.)

It may be good to add use of error/exception handler as best practice in the manual.
http://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.internal.php

There are bug reports that complain return value inconsistency. The document could be improved with more explanations.

Bug reports are not verified carefully. Removing wrong one, adding proper one is appreciated.

===== Developer Guideline =====

  * Internal function/method should raise error(or exception) for invalid parameters. (parse parameters function does this)
  * Internal function/method is better to return NULL for invalid parameters as most functions do.
  * Internal function/method is better to return FALSE for other errors.

===== User Guideline =====

  * User should not rely return value only for failure condition, but should rely error/exception handler for failure also.
