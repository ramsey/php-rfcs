  * Version: 0.4

  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====
''str_starts_with'' checks if a string, //s//, begins with another string, //s′// and returns a boolean value (''true''/''false'') if //s// starts with //s′//. 
''str_ends_with'' checks if a a string, //s//, ends with another string, //s′// and returns a boolean value (''true''/''false'') if //s// ends with //s′//. 

Typically this functionality is accomplished by repurposing existing string functions such as  '[[http://php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php|substr]]', '[[http://php.net/manual/en/function.strncmp.php|strncmp]]', '[[http://php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php|strpos]]', or '[[http://php.net/manual/en/function.substr_compare.php|substr_compare]]'. These bespoke userland implementations have various downsides, discussed later in this RFC.

The ''str_starts_with'' and ''str_ends_with'' functionality is so important, and so problematic to leave to userland, that many major PHP frameworks support it including [[https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/string.html#usage|Symfony]], [[https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/helpers#method-starts-with|Laravel]],[[https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/2.0/yii-helpers-basestringhelper#startsWith()-detail|Yii]], [[https://fuelphp.com/docs/classes/str.html#/method_starts_with|FuelPHP]], and [[https://docs.phalcon.io/3.4/en/api/phalcon_text|Phalcon]]. Please note, the links are for ''str_starts_with'' functionality, but they all also contain ''str_ends_with'' functionality. 

Checking the start and end of strings is a very common task which should be easy. Accomplishing this task is not easy now and that is why many frameworks have chosen to include it. This is also why other programming languages, as diverse as JavaScript, Java, Haskell, and Matlab, have also implemented this functionality. Checking the start and end of a string should not be a task which requires pulling in a PHP framework or developing a potentially suboptimal function in userland. 

===== Downsides of Common Userland Approaches =====
All userland implementations of this functionality suffer from being less intuitive than specific standard functions. This especially for new PHP developers and developers who frequently switch between PHP and other languages, many of which include this functionality. Additionally, there are performance, shown below, with many userland implementations.
 
=== str_starts_with ===
<PHP>
substr($haystack, 0, strlen($needle)) === $needle
</PHP>
This is memory inefficient because it requires an unnecessary copy of part of $haystack.

<PHP>
$haystack = "string";
$needle = "string2";
strncmp($subject, "prefix", 6) === 0;
</PHP>
This is error prone because it has a hard-coded length for the prefix.

=== str_ends_with ===
<PHP>
strpos(strrev($haystack), strrev($needle)) === 0
</PHP>
This is CPU inefficient because it requires reversing both $haystack and $needle as well as applying ''strpos''. Also, note that if $haystack does not end in $needle, this is extra inefficient because it will search the string for the position of $needle. Also note that if $needle is empty a warning will be raised.

<PHP>
$needle ===  "" || substr_compare($haystack, $needle, -strlen($needle)) === 0)
</PHP>
This is more efficient than the prior example but exceptionally verbose and not immediately intuitive. Note that ''$needle === ""'' is required in order to ensure that empty $needles are handled appropriately.

===== Proposal =====
Add two new basic functions: ''str_starts_with'' and ''str_ends_with'':

<PHP>
str_starts_with ( string $haystack , string $needle ) : bool
str_ends_with ( string $haystack , string $needle ) : bool
</PHP>
  
''str_starts_with()'' checks if ''$haystack'' begins with ''$needle''. If ''$needle'' is longer than ''$haystack'', it returns ''false''; else, it compares each character in ''$needle'' with the corresponding character in ''$haystack'' (aligning both strings at their start), returning ''false'' if it encounters a mismatch, and ''true'' otherwise.\\
''str_ends_with()'' does the same thing but aligning both strings at their end.

Examples below:

<PHP>
$str = "beginningMiddleEnd";
if (str_starts_with($str, "beg")) echo "printed\n";
if (str_starts_with($str, "Beg")) echo "not printed\n";
if (str_ends_with($str, "End")) echo "printed\n";
if (str_ends_with($str, "end")) echo "not printed\n";

// empty strings:
if (str_starts_with("a", "")) echo "printed\n";
if (str_starts_with("", "")) echo "printed\n";
if (str_starts_with("", "a")) echo "not printed\n";
if (str_ends_with("a", "")) echo "printed\n";
if (str_ends_with("", "")) echo "printed\n";
if (str_ends_with("", "a")) echo "not printed\n";
 </PHP>

Please note, the behavior concerning empty strings is in accordance with the behavior of the accepted [[rfc:str_contains|str_contains RFC]]. This behavior is also the same as is common with other languages, including Java and Python.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This could break functions existing in userland with the same names. But see [[rfc:str_contains#backward_incompatible_changes|the corresponding section in the str_contains RFC]] for a discussion illustrating how this concern may be mitigated and why this concern does not justify the rejection of this RFC.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 8

===== RFC Impact =====
  * **To SAPIs:** Will add the aforementioned functions to all PHP environments.
  * **To Existing Extensions:** None.
  * **To Opcache:** No effect.
  * **New Constants:** No new constants.
  * **php.ini Defaults:** No changed php.ini settings.
