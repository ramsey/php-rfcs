====== PHP RFC: Native Regular Expression ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2014-08-13
  * Author: Bishop Bettini, bishop@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/native_regular_expressions

FIXME FIXME FIXME
Jotting my ideas down here.  Move along. Maybe called "first_class_citizens_regex" or something.

New built-in "re".  BNF is roughly:

<code>
syntax := re <fence-post> <regex-chars> <fence-post> <regex-modifiers> <semic>
fence-post := <any character>
regex-chars := whatever is allowed in a regex
regex-modifiers := whatever is valid for modifiers
semic := ';'
</code>

Example:
<code>
$regex = re /^\w+$/i
preg_match($regex, 'whatever');
ereg_match($regex, 'whatever'); // wouldn't work... maybe need $regex->test()
</code>

====== Motivation ======
  * Regex are integral to modern info processing
  * Quoting them inside strings is hard: you have the quote character to deal with, plus the fence post
  * Other languages have re built in

====== Goals ======
  * Reduce effort of code authors to quote regex properly
  * Compile time verification of regex (benefit?)

====== Non-goals ======
  * Adding a new regex class, with methods like $re->test('whatever')

This is a suggested template for PHP Request for Comments (RFCs). Change this template to suit your RFC.  Not all RFCs need to be tightly specified.  Not all RFCs need all the sections below.
Read https://wiki.php.net/rfc/howto carefully!


Quoting [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/71525|Rasmus]]:

> PHP is and should remain:
> 1) a pragmatic web-focused language
> 2) a loosely typed language
> 3) a language which caters to the skill-levels and platforms of a wide range of users

Your RFC should move PHP forward following his vision. As [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66065|said by Zeev Suraski]] "Consider only features which have significant traction to a
large chunk of our userbase, and not something that could be useful in some
extremely specialized edge cases [...] Make sure you think about the full context, the huge audience out there, the consequences of  making the learning curve steeper with
every new feature, and the scope of the goodness that those new features bring."

===== Introduction =====
The elevator pitch for the RFC. The first paragraph in this section will be slightly larger to give it emphasis; please write a good introduction.

===== Proposal =====
All the features and examples of the proposal.

To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain hows the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
for inclusion in one of the world's most popular programming languages.

Remember that the RFC contents should be easily reusable in the PHP Documentation.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
List the proposed PHP versions that the feature will be included in.  Use relative versions such as "next PHP 5.x" or "next PHP 5.x.y".

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
Describe the impact to CLI, Development web server, embedded PHP etc.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Will existing extensions be affected?

==== To Opcache ====
It is necessary to develop RFC's with opcache in mind, since opcache is a core extension distributed with PHP.

Please explain how you have verified your RFC's compatibility with opcache.

==== New Constants ====
Describe any new constants so they can be accurately and comprehensively explained in the PHP documentation.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values
  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
List existing areas/features of PHP that will not be changed by the RFC.

This helps avoid any ambiguity, shows that you have thought deeply about the RFC's impact, and helps reduces mail list noise.

===== Future Scope =====
This sections details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Include these so readers know where you are heading and can discuss the proposed voting options.

State whether this project requires a 2/3 or 50%+1 majority (see [[voting]])

===== Patches and Tests =====
Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====
Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
