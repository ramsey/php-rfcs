===== Introduction =====
Debug, error, and exception messages in PHP often contain type information about variables that did not satisfy a defined validation constraint. The idiomatic way to add this type information is currently via the ''[[https://secure.php.net/gettype|gettype()]]'' function, however, the information that can be retrieved via that function is very sparse and developers need to repeat certain patterns over and over again to enrich it. This RFC proposes a new function called ''var_info()'' that addresses this issue and helps developers to create better debug, error, and exception messages in their software.

===== Proposal =====
Research of big and successful PHP userland projects (e.g. a search with ''is_object\([^\)]+\)\s*\?\s*get_class\([^\)]+\)\s*:\s*gettype'' shows 44 results in a fresh Drupal 8.2.x checkout with all composer dependencies installed) has shown that the ''gettype()'' function is often used as follows:

<code php>
$type = is_object($var) ? get_class($var) : gettype($var);
</code>

The result of such a check is then mostly used as part of an error message. It is trivial to write the above line of code, and the performance hit of an additional function call is negligible (due to the fact that it is usually only executed in error branches of software). Nevertheless, it is an unnecessary hurdle, and the so retrieved information on the type is not very extensive. Hence, the proposal for a new function that is called ''var_info()'' that works as follows:

<code php>
echo var_info([]);                               // array
echo var_info([SomeClass::class, 'someMethod']); // callable array
echo var_info([new SomeClass, 'someMethod']);    // callable array
echo var_info(false);                            // false
echo var_info(-1.0);                             // negative float
echo var_info(0.0);                              // zero float
echo var_info(1.0);                              // positive float
echo var_info(INF);                              // infinite float
echo var_info(NAN);                              // invalid float
echo var_info(-1);                               // negative int
echo var_info(0);                                // zero int
echo var_info(1);                                // positive int
echo var_info(new stdClass);                     // object of class stdClass
echo var_info(new Some\Namespaced\UserClass);    // object of class Some\Namespaced\UserClass
echo var_info(unserialize('O:1:"A":0:{}'));      // object of class __PHP_Incomplete_Class
echo var_info(function () {});                   // object of class Closure
echo var_info(STDIN);                            // resource of type stream
$fh = tmpfile();
fclose($fh);
echo var_info($fh);                              // closed resource
echo var_info('string');                         // string
echo var_info('strlen');                         // callable string
echo var_info('SomeClass::someMethod');          // callable string
echo var_info('10');                             // numeric string
echo var_info('1.0');                            // numeric string
echo var_info(true);                             // true
</code>

The following table summarizes the possible return values in a more readable form:

^ Return Value            ^ Comment ^
| ''array''               | |
| ''callable array''      | ''[[https://secure.php.net/is_callable|is_callable()]]'' |
| ''false''               | ''bool(false)'' |
| ''negative float''      | ''$var < 0.0'' |
| ''zero float''          | ''$var === 0.0 || $var === -0.0'' |
| ''positive float''      | ''$var > 0.0'' |
| ''infinite float''      | ''[[https://secure.php.net/is_infinite|is_infinite()]]'' |
| ''invalid float''       | ''[[https://secure.php.net/is_nan|is_nan()]]'' |
| ''negative int''        | ''$var < 0'' |
| ''zero int''            | ''$var === 0 || $var === -0'' |
| ''positive int''        | ''$var > 0'' |
| ''object of class %s''  | ''%s'' will contain the result of ''[[https://secure.php.net/get_class|get_class()]]''. |
| ''resource of type %s'' | ''%s'' will contain the result of ''[[https://secure.php.net/get_resource_type|get_resource_type()]]''. |
| ''closed resource''     | If no type is available anymore or is invalid/unknown. |
| ''string''              | |
| ''callable string''     | ''[[https://secure.php.net/is_callable|is_callable()]]'' |
| ''numeric string''      | ''[[https://secure.php.net/is_numeric|is_numeric()]]'' |
| ''true''                | ''bool(true)'' |

The return values do not contain any kind of special characters like brackets in order to not interfere with the formatting a developer might choose to format her message (e.g. //(// and //)// are not appropriate within //(// and //)// in English language). This should be taken into account in possible future extensions of this function.

Developers should however not rely on the returned values for anything other than outputting them. This is because the returned values might change in any major PHP release, the PHP team will of course take careful care not to alter the output during non-major releases, but it is still highly discouraged.
