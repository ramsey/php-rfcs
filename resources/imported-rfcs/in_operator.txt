===== Introduction =====
This RFC adds a new ''in'' operator which simplifies ''contains'' checks for strings and arrays. Currently, we have to use ''in_array($needle, $haystack, true)'' or ''strpos($haystack, $needle) !== false''. These functions have a inconsistent parameter order, so it's hard to remember which is the right one for each. The ''in'' operator makes these checks way more readable. Additionally, it also works for ''Traversable''.

===== Proposal =====
Add a new operator ''(expr1) in (expr2)''. It checks whether ''expr2'' contains ''expr1''.

It uses strict comparison (''==='') for array values / instances of ''Traversable'' and doesn't search recursively.

<code php>
$contains = "foo" in ["a", "b", "c"]; // false
$contains = "foo" in ["foo", "bar"]; // true
$contains = "foo" in [["foo"], ["bar"]]; // false
$contains = "0e0" in ["0"]; // false, because of strict comparison
$contains = 0 in ["0"]; // false, because of strict comparison
</code>

<code php>
function gen () {
    yield "foo";
    yield "bar";
}

$contains = "bar" in gen();
</code>

If the first parameter is an array , it checks for every element whether it's contained in the ''$haystack'' or not. This is an advantage compared to ''in_array''. It doesn't check the values in ''$needle'' recursively, so it's still possible to check if an array contains another array, but makes checking multiple scalars easier:

<code php>
$contains = ["foo", "bar"] in ["foo", "baz", "bar"]; // true
$contains = ["foo", "bar", "baz"] in ["foo", "bar"]; // false
$contains = [["foo", "bar"]] in [["foo", "bar"], ["foo", "baz"]]; // true
$contains = [["foo", "bar"]] in ["foo", "bar"]; // false
</code>

For strings, it behaves exactly like ''strpos($haystack, $needle) !== false'':
<code php>
$contains = "foo" in "foobar"; // true
$contains = "php" in "foobar"; // false
</code>

Objects are not supported, because we already have ''isset'' here.

==== Why strict? ====
It's strict because otherwise something like ''"foo" in [0]'' would be true.

==== Precedence ====
It should have the same precedence as ''instanceof'', so it's possible to negate it:

<code php>
if (!$input in $validValues) {
    // ...
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
New reserved keyword ''in''. This affects function, constants, class and method names.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next major release, at the time of writing PHP 7.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== New Constants ====
A ''T_IN'' constant for use with ext/tokenizer has been added.

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Future Scope =====
None.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Requires a 2/3 majority, simple yes / no vote.

===== Patches and Tests =====
TBD

===== Implementation =====
TBD

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
