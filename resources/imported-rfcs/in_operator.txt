====== PHP RFC: In Operator ======

  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====
This RFC adds a new ''in'' operator which simplifies ''contains'' checks for strings and arrays. Currently, we have to use ''in_array($needle, $haystack, true)'' or ''strpos($haystack, $needle) !== false''. These functions have a inconsistent parameter order, so it's hard to remember which is the right one for each. The ''in'' operator makes these checks way more readable and lowers the cognitive load. Additionally, it also works for ''Traversable''.

===== Proposal =====
Add a new operator ''(expr1) in (expr2)''. It checks whether ''expr2'' contains ''expr1''.

It uses strict comparison (''==='') for array values / instances of ''Traversable'' and doesn't search recursively.

<code php>
$contains = "foo" in ["a", "b", "c"]; // false
$contains = "foo" in ["foo", "bar"]; // true
$contains = "foo" in [["foo"], ["bar"]]; // false
$contains = "0e0" in ["0"]; // false, because of strict comparison
$contains = 0 in ["0"]; // false, because of strict comparison

$contains = ["foo"] in [["foo"], ["bar"]]; // true
$contains = ["foo"] in ["foo"]; // false
</code>

''Traversable''s are only iterated until there's a match.

<code php>
function gen () {
    yield "foo";
    yield "bar";
    // code below here wouldn't be executed if "bar" matches
    // because it stops if there's a match.
}

$contains = "bar" in gen(); // true
$contains = "baz" in gen(); // false
</code>

If ''$haystack'' is a string, it's a simple ''contains'' check.

<code php>
$contains = "foo" in "foobar"; // true
$contains = "php" in "foobar"; // false
</code>

Other expressions than ''mixed in array|Traversable'' or ''string in string'' throw an ''EngineException''.

==== Why strict? ====
It's strict because otherwise something like ''"foo" in [0]'' would pass.

==== Precedence ====
It should have the same precedence as ''instanceof'', so it's possible to negate it:

<code php>
if (!$input in $validValues) {
    // ...
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
New reserved keyword ''in''. This affects function, constant, class and method names.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next major release, at the time of writing PHP 7.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== New Constants ====
A ''T_IN'' constant for use with ext/tokenizer has been added.

===== Future Scope =====
There could be a syntax that allows to check for multiple values at once, e.g.
<code php>
$contains = ...["foo", "bar"] in ["foo", "baz", "bar"];
</code>

===== Votes =====
Requires a 2/3 majority. Even if it passes, it will //only// get merged if the [[rfc/context_sensitive_lexer|context sensitive lexer]] gets merged.

===== Patches and Tests =====
  * https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1121

===== Rejected Features =====
Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.

===== Changelog =====
  * v0.5: Removed integer support, so the strictness is consistent.
  * v0.4: Removed possibility to check multiple values using an array.
