===== Introduction =====

PHP uses Subversion (SVN) as its version control system of choice at the
moment.  These has a few drawbacks. A decentralized version control system
can solve some of these drawbacks. This RFC aims to provide information to
choose one of the proposed decentralized version control systems (DVCS).

===== Current Situation =====
Subversion is used to host the main PHP repository and sub projects such as
PEAR and PECL. Access is granted through an implemented Karma System (KARMA).
Using Subversion has drawbacks:
  * requires network access
  * slow log/annotate commands
  * large checkout sizes
  * single point of failure
  * painful merging
  * no implizit consistency checks

Decentralized version control system can solve this:
  * better merging support
  * consistency checks using SHA1 checksums
  * local repository, no network access required to commit
  * network access only for push/pull
  * no single point of failure, easy to setup multiple hosting
  * advanced features such as rebase to linearise history, bisect to find regression bugs
  * "social coding platforms" enabling developers to easily submit patches.

Decentralized version control system have some drawbacks:
  * no partial checkout of subdirectories
  * no empty directories, .keep file needed
  * no global unique incrementing rev numbers, sha1s are global unique revnums
  * no svn:externals, no svn:eol-style

===== Overview Competitors =====
==== Git ====
Git was written by Linus Torvalds as a replacement for BitKeeper that was
used for Linux Kernel development until 2005. Git is used by various large
Open Source Projects, including Perl, VLC and Gnome. It is considered
the fastest Open Source DVCS.

Git is written in C, Shell and Perl. It runs under Linux, BSD and Mac OS X.
A Windows version based on msys is available through the msysgit project.

  Mailinglist:  http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#git
  Wiki:         https://git.wiki.kernel.org/
  Version:      1.7.6

==== Mercurial ====
Mercurial was written by Matt Mackall in 2005. It is used by large Open
Source Projects like OpenJDK, Python and Mozilla. It is written in Python
with some modules written in C for performance reasons. Mercurial is
available for Linux, BSD, Mac OS X and Windows.  Mercurials command line
name is 'hg' - a reference to the symbol of the chemical element Mercury.

===== Concepts =====
While every version control system has it's own terminology, some terms
are used in every decentralized version control system. Here is a list
of common definitions:

repository
    A collection of revisions, organized into branches
clone
    A complete copy of a branch or repository
commit
    To record a revision in a repository
merge
    Apply all the changes and history from one branch or repository to another
pull
    To update a checkout/clone from the original branch/repository, which can be
    remote or local
push
    To copy a revisions from one repository to another

==== Revision Model ====
Git and Mercurial use string representations of SHA1 checksums to identify
a changeset. Both version control systems offer reserved names to access
often used changesets such as the topmost commit. In both systems a user 
can specify only the a part of the full SHA1 as long as this part identifies
a single changeset.

In addition to global revision numbers, Mercurial offers local revision
numbers.  They are incrementing integers that can be used to indentify a
changeset. Multiple repositories of the same project do not necessarily
have the same local revisions.

==== Branching Model ====
Git and Mercurial have fundamental differences in their branching model.

Git uses pointers to a changeset to define a branch. Every ancestor of a
changeset that is marked that way is part of the branch. If you delete
the pointer the name of the branch is gone and can only be recovered
using the so called reflog if it's not yet expired.  This means that
you cannot bring back the name of a branch after a few years.

Mercurial on the other side records the name of the branch in the changeset
itself. Once you've comitted to a branch, the branch name will stay. You
can close a branch, but you cannot remove the branch name without altering history.
The drawback of this approach is that branches are not suited very well for small
living test branches as naming conflicts can occur. Mercurial offers so called
Bookmarks and Anonymous Branches that work similar to Git's branching model
to solve this.

===== Workflows =====
The following section describes typical work flows. Note that not all Subverison
work flows translate one-to-one to a DVCS.

=== Setup ===
== Git ==
    git config --global ui.user "David Soria Parra"
    git config --global ui.email "dsp@php.net"

== Mercurial ==
Edit ~/.hgrc
    [ui]
    username = David Soria Parra <dsp@php.net>

=== Checkout and Patch ===
== Git ==
    $ git clone git://git.php.net/php-src.git
    $ git checkout PHP_5_4
    ... hack Zend/zend.c ...
    $ git commit Zend/zend.c
    $ git push

== Mercurial ==
    $ hg clone http://hg.php.net/php-src
    $ hg update PHP_5_4
    ... hack Zend/zend.c ...
    $ hg commit
    $ hg push

=== Port patches across branches ===
== Git ==
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge PHP_5_4
    or
    $ git checkout trunk
    $ git cherry-pick a32ba2 # assuming a32ba2 is the commit to port
    
== Mercurial ==
    $ hg update default
    $ hg merge PHP_5_4
    or with the transplant extension installed
    $ hg update default
    $ hg transplant a32ba2

=== Releasing a version ===
== Git ==
    $ git checkout PHP_5_4
    $ git tag --sign v5.4.1
    $ git push origin v5.4.1

== Mercurial ==
    $ hg update PHP_5_4
    $ hg tag v5.4.1
    $ hg push

=== Backport Patch ===
== Git ==
To backport a changeset you can use the git cherry-pick feature.

In some circumstances this can lead to duplicated commits that can cause
troubles during merges, so backporting a feature is discouraged. Try
to apply a patch to the oldest currently maintained branch and merge this
branch to maintained release branches.

    $ git checkout master
    .. hack hack ..
    .. commit rev 3ab3f
    $ git checkout PHP_5_4
    $ git cherry-pick 3ab3f

== Mercurial ==
To backport a changeset you can use the hg transplant feature from
from the transplant extension that is shipped with Mercurial.

In some circumstances this can lead to duplicated commits that can cause
troubles during merges, so backporting a feature is discouraged. Try
to apply a patch to the oldest currently maintained branch and merge this
branch to maintained release branches.

    $ hg update master
    .. hack hack ..
    .. commit rev 3ab3f
    $ hg update PHP_5_4
    $ hg transplant 3ab3f

=== Moving extension from/to core to/from pecl ===
We will use separate repositories for PECL and PEAR modules. php-src will
be a separate module. We need a mechanism to move extensions from PECL to core and vice
versa.

Both Mercurial and Git support subrepositories (called submodules in git). These are
external references to repositories. The advantage of this approach is, that it's very
easy to add and remove modules by just modifying the external references.
The drawback of this approach is that you will not have a combined history log of
all subrepositories. Commits across multiple subrepositories will lead so separate commits.
Mercurial and git will not know that these commits are related.

An alternative to this approach is the use of subtree merges. You can
merge a repository into a subdirectory of a repository. This way you will
end up with the merged history being a full part of the repositories history.
The drawback of this approach is that you need a depth knowledge to perform such
merges or splitting repositories again. A similar approach can be used with Mercurial
by using the convert extension and merge.

In our use case it makes more sense to use subtree merges. Moving extension from
or to core doesn't happen frequently and the overhead in performing the merges and splitting
is worth the benefit of having one php-src repository that contains all extensions including
their full history.

===== Tools and Platform Support =====

==== Operating Systems ====
Mercurial is available for all major platforms: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X,
Windows. All core features are available on supported platforms.

Git is available for Linux, BSD and Mac OS X. Windows binaries based on
msys are provided by the msysgit project. As early Git versions primarly targeted
Linux, some commands can still be slower or even non-existant on Windows.

==== CLRF -> LF ====
Git supports CRLF to LF conversion. This can be configured using the variables
core.autocrlf, core.safecrlf and gitattributes.

Mercurial supports CRLF to LF conversion using the EOL extension.

==== GUI ====
Mercuial: Various GUI tools are available. TortoiseHG, HGK, MacHG, Eclipse, Emacs, etc

Git: Various GUI tools are available: TortoiseGit, gitk, git-cola, qgit, Eclipse, Emacs, etc

==== Web ====

===== The PHP Karma System =====
PHP uses a self implemented access control system, that is usually called Karma. The system consist
of two parts. The first part is the link to the PHP user management. The authentication part checks if a user is registered
in the PHP user system and if the passwords match. The authorization part checks if the user is allowed
to commit to the directory he wants to commit to.

==== Authentication ====
Both Git and Mercurial support SSH and HTTP. We will focus on HTTP as we cannot manage SSH keys for all users that have
access to the PHP repository. HTTP will also enable you to push and pull though most cooperate firewalls.

=== Git ===
Git can use HTTP basic auth to verify is a user is allowed to login. We can use HTTP Digest for authentication and an ''update'' hook to check if the user is authorized to push to that directory.

=== Mercurial ===
Mercurial can use HTTP basic auth. We can use HTTP Digest for authentication and a hook to check if the user has the necessary access rights.


===== Unqiue features =====
==== Git ====
=== Index ===
Git implements a index (also called staging area) between repository and
working directory that keeps track of changed files. Only changes that
are tracked in the index are part of the next changeset upon commit. This
makes it possible to just "stage" parts of the changes made to the working
directory (see: git add -p). The drawback of this approach is that you
have to manually stage a change or use the --all switch in git commit.
While this is a powerful feature, it can confuse people coming from
other version control systems.

=== Separate Author and Commiter ===
Git separates author and commiter and records both in a changeset. A
commit can have a different author than a committer. This is useful
for PHP as a patch from the mailinglist will be committed with the
original author and the information who committed it, making it easier
to identifier who wrote the patch initially.

==== Mercurial ====
=== Local Revision Numbers ===
Both Git and Mercurial use SHA1 to identify a changeset and ensure it's
globally unique. The string representation of a SHA1 is the revision
number. Incremented integers cannot identify a changeset globally but
they are useful shortcuts in local repositories.

Mercurial uses incremented integers, similar to SVN revision numbers
on changesets. These can be used on a local repository to identify a
revision. Git only supports SHA1.

Changeset

    changeset:   75485:61e266b471e4
    branch:      PHP_5_4
    tag:         tip
    parent:      75482:b5e860dc2f05
    user:        sixd@c90b9560-bf6c-de11-be94-00142212c4b1
    date:        Mon Jul 25 17:30:09 2011 +0000
    summary:     Patch r313663 and r313665 to allow PECL builds to work with earlier releases

has the local revision number 75485 and the global 61e266b471e4.

=== Revsets and Filesets ===
Mercurial has a powerful query language to select changests or files to
include in log, diff and similar commands. For example, to search for
the last tagged revision that includes a given changeset you can run
the following query:

    hg log -r 'limit(descendants($1) and tagged(), 1)'

=== Extensions ===
Mercurial is written in Python and supports loading and executing
Mercurial extensions written in Python that can access the internal
Mercurial API.

Mercurial extensions are a common way to implement additional features
such as rebase, commit signatures and access control. Mercurial ships
with a set of core extensions. A full list of extensions can be found
in the Mercurial wiki.

===== Benchmarks =====
The tests were done with Git v1.7.6 and Mercurial 1.9 on a Thinkpad X201,
Intel i5 M540 @2.53 Ghz, Samsung 128 GB SDD, 4 GB RAM.

For the php-src repository (not the complete repository):

^ Benchmark                         ^ Git      ^ Mercurial                         ^
| Repository Size                   | 120 MB   | 197 MB (with hg 1.9 generaldelta) |
| Switching branch trunk -> PHP_5_4 | 0.182s   | 1.328s                            |
| Annontate file (Zend/zend.c)      | 2.936s   | 0.745s                            |
| Log over the last 1000 commits    | 0.752s   | 1.111s                            |

===== Hosting Infrastructure =====
The main repository will be hosted at php.net. This will make implementing infrastructure
or scripts easier and gives us full power over our development environment.

Other hosting sites can be used to attract more developers. DVCS make it easy to push
a repository to different locations and keep them in sync.

==== Git / Github ====
The most popular hosting site for Git based projects is github.com. Github
encourages people to interact with hosted projects by making it easy to
clone a repository and send a "pull request" to the upstream project.

Github reserved a PHP user for the PHP project wiht unlimited public
repositories.  We can use this account to create a repository and use
pull requests from github to integrate into PHP.

A typical workflow for example is:

  1. Pull pull request from github.com
  2. Merge locally
  3. Push merge to git.php.net
  4. Automatic sync between git.php.net <-> github will push the changes
     to github. The pull request will be closed automatically.

=== Subversion Integration ===
Github supports a SVN bridge. You can checkout and commit to a repository
using SVN.  Advanced subversion features such as properties do not work.

==== Mercurial / Bitbucket ====
Bitbucket is a popular hosting site for Mercurial projects. It is build
similar to github, although the amount of hosted projects is smaller
then on github.

A typical workflow for example is:

  1. Pull pull request from bitbucket.org
  2. Merge locally
  3. Push merge to hg.php.net
  4. Automatic sync between hg.php.net <-> bitbucket will push the changes
     to github. The pull request will be closed automatically.

=== Subversion Integration ===
Bitbucket supports a SVN bridge. You can checkout and commit to
a repository using SVN.  The subversion integration is in beta
phase. Commits can fail under certain circumstances.

===== Implementation =====
The implementation details are handled in subsequent RFCs. Important issues that
can influence the decision are outlined in this RFC.

We will not convert the whole SVN repository at once.  As Git and
Mercurial do not allow checkouts of subdirectories. We have to split up
the repository into modules. To guarantee minimal downtimes and having a
smooth transition, we will move module after module. The first module will
be php-src and the karma system. Other modules like systems will follow.

==== Migration RFC ====
The migration of modules is handled through the following RFCs:

  - Migration of php-src and KARMA

more to follow.

===== Discussion ====
In this section I'll try to outline some qualitative evaluation based on discussion that I had about this topic with people from
the PHP community and with other users of Git and Mercurial.

It seems that Mercurial is considered easier to learn when coming from Subversion. It's extension system keeps the core commands
simple while advanced users can add more features. This extensibility can be useful when it comes to implementing the Karma system
or documentation related translation synchronization. Mercurial comes with excellent Windows support. It also has a very capable
HTTP support making it easy for people to pull and push through proxies. The ui is kept simple and Mercurial does not expose
low level commands. For people without much knowledge about version control systems and people coming from Subversion, Mercurial
is more suitable than Git.

Git is considered the most used DVCS in the Open Source community. Git does not have a plugin system, but the Karma system can be
implemented through push and pull hooks. Git offers HTTP support that can be used to push and pull through a proxy. Newer Git versions
offer a smart HTTP protocol, that can be considered equally good as the Mercurial HTTP support. Due to it's history concepts and the large set
of commands, git has a higher learning curve than similar systems. Git is widely used by Open Source projects written in PHP, such as Zend Framework,
Symphony 2, phpBB and xdebug. The most important argument in favour of Git, however, is not git itself, but Github. It has a large user base
and makes it very easy for people to participate on a project. It's far more popular than Bitbucket.
