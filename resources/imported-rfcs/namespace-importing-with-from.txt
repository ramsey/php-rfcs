====== Request for Comments: Enhance Namespace Importing With From Syntax ======

===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes adding a new <code php>from namespace use subnamespace as alias</code> syntax
to help reduce deplication when importing class/function/constants from namespace.

===== Use case =====

When importing multiple class/constant/function from a top namespace, we have to
duplicate the top level namespace multiple times.

<code php>
use Top\A\Long\Namespaced\ClassA;
use Top\A\Long\Namespaced\ClassB;
use Top\A\Long\Namespaced\ClassC;
</code>

This is hard to maintain and type, especially when the namespace is deep.

This RFC proposes a new syntax to allow developers reduce duplication as below:
<code php>
from Top\A\Long\Namespaced\NS use ClassA, ClassB, ClassC;
</code>

It's considered to be an equivalent to the previous multiple use statements.
This makes code less and easier to maintain.

We could import by combine multiple use statement to a single line.
<code php>
use Top\Namespaced\ClassA, Top\Namespaced\ClassB, Top\Namespaced\ClassC;
</code>
but it didn't reduce duplication either.

===== Syntax explain =====

This proposed RFC syntax introduce a new keyword: ''from''.

The syntax is ''from topnamespace use subns_class_func_cons [as alias] [, another_subns_class_func_cons [as alias] ...]''
In short this syntax enabled develpers to import several SYMBOLs from the same namespace once.

topnamespace could be considered as a prefix to every follow use statement:
<code php>
from Top\Namespaced use ClassA, ClassB, ClassC;
//equals to
Top\Namespaced\ClassA;
Top\Namespaced\ClassB;
Top\Namespaced\ClassB;

// we can also import different level
from \GloalNS\Company\Tools use \Tool1, use ToolCollection\NewTool as MyTool;
</code>

We could also import from global namespace by prefix with backslash. but we could only
prefix backslash before the namespace after ''from'', the namespace after ''use'' statement
could either, but it will not import from global namespace, since it's known to be a subnamespace.

==== Why ''from''? ====
It was inspired by Python, it use ''from xxx import yyy as zzz'', 
it's easy to understand what ''from'' means: eg: "use those classes from the namespace".
since PHP use ''use'' keyword to import symbol, 
so ''from namespace_ns use sub_namespace_or_symbol as alias'' is choosen.

==== Can we use * to import? ====
No 'use' itself didn't and from use syntax didn't either.

==== Any BC break? ====
There should no BC break here.

===== More examples =====

<code php>
<?php

namespace A {
	class B {}
}

namespace A\C {
	class X {}
	class Y {}
}

namespace {
	/*
     * use A\B
     */
	from A use B;

	/*
     * use A\B as B1;
     * use A\B as B2;
     */
	from A use B as B1, B as B2;

	/*
     * use A\C\X;
     * use A\C\Y;
     */
	from A\C use X, Y;

	/*
     * use \A\C\X as X1;
     * use \A\C\Y as Y1;
     */
	from \A\C use \X as X1, Y as Y1;

	$b = new B();
	$b1 = new B1();
	$b2 = new B2();
	$x = new X();
	$x1 = new X1();
	$y = new Y();
	$y1 = new Y1();

	var_dump($b, $b1, $b2, $x, $x1, $y, $y1);
	echo "===DONE===\n";
}
?>
--EXPECTF--
object(A\B)#1 (0) {
}
object(A\B)#2 (0) {
}
object(A\B)#3 (0) {
}
object(A\C\X)#4 (0) {
}
object(A\C\X)#5 (0) {
}
object(A\C\Y)#6 (0) {
}
object(A\C\Y)#7 (0) {
}
===DONE===
