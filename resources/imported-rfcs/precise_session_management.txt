===== Introduction =====

This proposal fixes session management design issue. Session ID management requires more precise management. Otherwise, 

  * Outstanding session ID is lost randomly.
  * Session ID cookie becomes empty randomly.
  * Increase risks of stolen session.


==== session_regenerate_id() ====

Keeping HTTP session as secure as possible is what the session manager's task. **Session manager can improve HTTP session security without user code modification while keeping compatibility with existing applications.** Please note that this RFC is for session manager behavior.

session_regenerate_id() is used to generate new session ID. It's better to delete old session data to reduce risk of session hijack. However, session_regenerate_id() leave old session data by default currently. (i.e. session_regenerate_id(FALSE) is the default) Old session data is active and usable until GC. 

Old session is left active for reliable session ID regeneration. There are many reasons why old session is left. Examples are:
  * Browsers connect to web server with multiple connections. 
  * Mobile network may loose radio, may have hand over, etc. 
  * Large network providers have multiple gateways for off loading traffic and packets may arrive out of order. 
For reliable session ID regeneration, only short periods (few seconds for wired connections, few minutes for mobile connection) is enough. 


**Leaving old session opens window to attacker widely:**
  - Old session lives long term and never expires if there is access to it. i.e. Attacker may abuse stolen session forever.
  - There is no mechanism to detect possibles attack even if session manager may detect attacks.

**Counter measure for session hijack:** Requirement - Session ID regeneration must be reliable.
  - Make sure old session is deactivated/deleted after certain period.
  - Raise error/exception for invalid access. (Raise error for should be deleted session access)

**Problem of immediate old session deletion:**
  - Make session ID regeneration unreliable. i.e. session_regenerate_id(TRUE) randomly destroy session data and/or browsers sent empty session ID. See referenced bug reports. (Unacceptable)
  - Remove alarm for possible attacks. (No detection = Insecure)

**"Make sure old session is deleted certain period"** and **"Raise error/exception for invalid access"** provides much better security than current way or immediate deletion.

Errors may be raised for either legitimate user or attacker. If error is raised for legitimate user, legitimate user could know they are under attack. (Possibly network is dangerous or app has vulnerability) If error is raised for attacker, attacker could know they might be caught by illegal access.

==== Session Expiration ====

Current session expiration is not precise as it depends on probability for deletion. This is similar to session_regenerate_id() issue currently exists. Session expiration should be more precise.


==== Risk of stolen session ====

Stealing session ID is easy regardless of HTTPS. Attacker can set up fake router by ARP spoofing. Most networks do not have ARP spoofing prevention, even detection. For HTTP, attacker can view session ID simply. For HTTPS, attacker can set up transparent HTTPS stripping proxy and steal session ID. Most users do not care much if they are connecting via HTTPS or not.

Above attack can be done by existing tools. i.e. Script kiddies' task.

==== This is known design issue for a long time ====

Even if there is only recent bug report for this, this bug is known more than 10 years since when session_regenerate_id() is introduced.

  * https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68063 
  * https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70584 



===== Proposal =====

  * Add transparent Session module internal array data <nowiki>$_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']</nowiki> to keep access timestamp, etc. Note: This array could be used to store data for automatic CSRF protection in the future also.
  * Add session.ttl INI and deprecate session.gc_maxlifetime
  * Add session.ttl_freq INI (TTL update frequency)
  * Add session.ttl_destroy INI (Session destroy TTL)
  * Add session_gc() function
  * Add $immediate_destroy flag for session_destroy([$immediate_destroy=FALSE]) (Be consistent with session_regenerate_id() or remove immediate deletion option at all because immediate session data removal causes severe problems.)

==== How session_regenerate_id() will work ====

**Add 'session.destroy_ttl' INI directive**(INI_ALL, default 300 seconds) and **"make sure old session is deleted certain period"**.

This can be achieved by time stamp in session data. When session_regenerate_id()/session_destroy() is called without parameter, session manager sets following for old session data.

NOTE: This is pseudocode.

<code php>
  $_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['NEW_SID'] = <new session id>;
  $_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['LAST_ACCESS'] = time();
</code>

New session data only has LAST_ACCESS.

<code php>
  $_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['LAST_ACCESS'] = time();
</code>

Under normal session usage, <nowiki>$_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']</nowiki> is used as follows

<code php>
  // Check obsolete session and destroy.
  if (isset($_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['NEW_SID'])) {
    if ($_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['LAST_ACCESS'] < time() + ini_get('session.ttl_destroy')) {
      // Remove session data
      // Send new session ID if LAST_SID_SENT is 60 sec before. (Prevent browser cookie storage race)
      // Raise warning for obsolete session data access
    }
  } else {
    // Do not update LAST_ACCESS for obsolete session. 
    // LAST_ACCESS is updated by session.ttl_freq for lazy_write to work.
    if (!isset($_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['NEW_SID'] &&
        $_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['LAST_ACCESS'] + ini_get('session.ttl_freq) < time()) {
      $_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['LAST_ACCESS'] = time(); // Update LAST_ACCESS time
    }
  }
</code>

User will never see <nowiki>$_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']</nowiki> array as it is removed/added upon session data serialization internally in session module. 

When session_regenerate_id(true)/session_destroy(true) is called, session module destroy session data immediately. (It may be better to remove immediate deletion because it causes serious errors)

Users may add $_SESSION['<nowiki>__SESSION_INTERNAL__</nowiki>']. When this is happened, session module raise E_WARNING and replace with the session internal data.


=== Why session.ttl_destroy default is 300 seconds and configurable ===

Session data may be lost when network connection is unstable. For example, when user enter elevator or subway, connection can be lost in a way that session data is lost. 300 seconds would be enough for most elevators. However, it may not be enough for subways. PHP developer may require longer TTL for better stability.

Some PHP developers may want to be more stric/shorter TTL even if it could result in lost session on occasions. They may set 30 seconds TTL which would be long enough for stable connection in most cases.

=== Why this is secure than now ===

Currently, users must call session_regenerate_id() without destroy flag to have stable session. Therefore, old session data is valid as long as it is accessed even if it should be discarded as invalid session. Attackers can take advantage of this behavior to keep stolen session forever.

Since current session depends on probability based GC, low traffic site may keep obsolete session data for long period.


==== $_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__'] data definition ====

  * <nowiki>$_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['LAST_ACCESS'] </nowiki> : Last access UNIX time.
  * <nowiki>$_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['NEW_SID'] </nowiki> : New session ID generated by session_regenerate_id(). If this is set, it means this session is obsolete.
  * <nowiki>$_SESSION['__SESSION_INTERNAL__']['LAST_SID_SENT'] </nowiki> : Used to prevent browser cookie storage race condition.

  
==== Adding session_gc() ====

Session TTL Timestamp eliminates needs of probability based expiration. However, garbage will be left. Therefore, there should be GC API for cron task for instance.


==== Adding session.ttl ====

Even though session.gc_maxlifetime could be used for TLL, it is no longer proper INI for session expiration control. There should be proper INI for TTL value.


===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

  * If user script has <nowiki>__SESSION_INTERNAL__</nowiki> key in $_SESSION, it may break application.
  * Raised error may break application.
  * Direct reading/decoding session data will see the <nowiki>__SESSION_INTERNAL__</nowiki> data. There are 3rd party libraries that read/write PHP encoded session data. New key may break apps use these libraries.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

  * None

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

  * Session

===== New Constants =====

  * None

===== php.ini Defaults =====

If there are any php.ini settings then list:
  * hardcoded default values
  * php.ini-development values
  * php.ini-production values

New

  * "session.ttl = 1440" for all. (1440 seconds. Replaces session.gc_maxlifetime. INI_ALL)
  * "session.ttl_freq = 300" for all. (300 seconds. TTL update frequency. If TTL is updated for every request, lazy_write won't work. INI_ALL)
  * "session.ttl_destroy = 300" for all. (300 seconds. TTL value for removing obsolete session. INI_ALL)

Existing
  * "session.gc_divisor = 10000" for all. Currently, 100 hardcoded, 1000 for development/production. Changed since frequent GC is not required with new session management.
