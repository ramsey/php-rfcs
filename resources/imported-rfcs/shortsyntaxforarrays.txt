This RFC will discuss an language enhancement for simple and easy array definition.

===== Update: May 2011 =====

This topic has come up again on the list. 

===== Introduction =====

In some cases it is necessary that you have to pass function parameters as an array.
Especially when you work with nested arrays the php array function tends to make the code
looking ugly. If you take a look at other languages (Ruby, Python, Javascript) there is
a short syntax for arrays using square brackets. Maybe PHP should adopt this behaviour
to make code more readable and maintainable.

Another solution would be to implement [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_argument|named parameters]].

===== Syntax =====

Ryusuke suggested two possibly syntaxes and also provides two patches for a solution:

**Square bracket array shortcut - keys and values are separated by colons:**
<code php>
    $a = [1, 2, 3];
    $b = ['foo': 'orange', 'bar': 'apple', 'baz': 'lemon'];
</code>

**Square bracket array shortcut - keys and values are separated by double arrows:**
<code php>
    $a = [1, 2, 3];
    $b = ['foo' => 'orange', 'bar' => 'apple', 'baz' => 'lemon'];
</code>

===== Proposal and Patch =====

The first solution is more compact: http://www.opendogs.org/pub/php-5.3dev-080109-sbar.patch \\
The second solution is more "The PHP Way": http://www.opendogs.org/pub/php-5.3dev-080109-sbar2.patch \\


===== Pro / Contra =====

Pro and contra arguments that were derived from the list.

==== Pro ====

  * Good for framework development when dealing with long parameterlists 
  * Other web languages have similar syntax
  * Readable


==== Contra ====

  * Yet another alias
  * Would take distinctness from []
  * Not searchable through search engines
  * Unreadable
  * Patch may be difficult to maintain in future

===== Conclusion =====

This patch will not be accepted because slight majority of the core developers voted against. Though if you take a accumulated mean between core developers and userland votes seems to show the opposite it would be irresponsible to submit a patch witch is not supported or maintained in the long run.
