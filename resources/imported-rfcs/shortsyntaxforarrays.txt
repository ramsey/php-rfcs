This RFC will discuss an language enhancement for simple and easy array definition.

===== Introduction =====

In some cases it is necessary that you have to pass function parameters as an array.
Especially when you work with nested arrays the php array function tends to make the code
looking ugly. If you take a look at other languages (Ruby, Python, Javascript) there is
a short syntax for arrays using square brackets. Maybe PHP should adopt this behaviour
to make code more readable and maintainable.

Another solution would be to implement named parameters.

==== Syntax ====

Ryusuke suggested two possibly syntaxes and also provides two patches for a solution:

# Commit square bracket array shortcut patch keys and values are separated by colons.
<code php>
    $a = [1, 2, 3];
    $b = ['foo': 'orange', 'bar': 'apple', 'baz': 'lemon'];
</code>
# Commit square bracket array shortcut patch keys and values are separated by double arrows.
<code php>
    $a = [1, 2, 3];
    $b = ['foo' => 'orange', 'bar' => 'apple', 'baz' => 'lemon'];
</code>

===== Proposal and Patch =====

The first solution is more compact: http://www.opendogs.org/pub/php-5.3dev-080109-sbar.patch
The second solution is more "The PHP Way": http://www.opendogs.org/pub/php-5.3dev-080109-sbar2.patch
