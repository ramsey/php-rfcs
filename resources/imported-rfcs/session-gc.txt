===== Introduction =====

Current session GC depends on probability. Thus, low traffic sites would not delete expired session data and could be usable as valid session. Traffic varies day and night time for high traffic sites. Chances are high that expired session may not be deleted as it should. 

The best way to purge old session data is executing GC periodically.

===== Proposal =====

  * Add session_gc() API.
  * Document calling session_gc() periodically is the best practice.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.1
