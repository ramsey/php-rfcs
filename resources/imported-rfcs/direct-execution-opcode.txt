====== PHP RFC: Direct execution opcode file without php source code file ======
  * Version: 0.1

  * Author: chopins xiao(chopins.xiao@gmail.com)
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/direct-execution-opcode

===== Introduction =====
Allow php direct execution opcode file without php source file.

===== Proposal =====
Copy use **opcache_compile_file()** function complie result file to special path. then prepend flag (**<?phpo**) and php_version_id to copy of file.

When executing, judge whether the loaded PHP file is an opcode file based on the flag. if no flag, will run as it is now.If is opcode file will direct execution without check php source file.

Change function to:
<PHP>
opcache_compile_file(string $file, string $opcode_file = null): bool
</PHP>

==== Implementation Method====

**compile to file:**

1. current opcache store to file:

php**--->**load code**--->**compile to opcode **--->**store to cache system directory**-->**same path file

2. path added optional:

php--->load code--->compile to opcode--->save to cache system directory-->same path file-->**copy cache file to the specified path**

**opcache exec process:**

1. current opcache exec:
<PHP>
[php]-->[find cache in cache system directory]-->[found] -->[exec opcode]
                                                   \--->[not found]--> [exec php source]
</PHP>

2. path added optional:
<PHP>
[php/phpo]--->[is phpo, <?phpo exist]--->[load the <?phpo file] ---->[exec opcode]
          \---->[not phpo] ---> [find cache in cache system directory]-->[found] -->[exec opcode]
                                                   \------------>[not found] --> [exec php source]-->[auto cache opcode]
</PHP>
===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This change causes **%%__FILE__%%** path obtained by the constant is not the path to the opcode file, but the path to the compiled PHP file.**%%__DIR__%%** this is also the problem.
The file path obtained by **error reporting**, **exceptions**, **reflections**, will also be the path to the compiled file, not the current opcode file path.

===== Proposed PHP Version =====
PHP 8.x

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
not support direct execution opcode file in phar.

==== To Opcache ====
Opcache can direct execution opcode file without php source file. 
When direct execution opcode file, will remove verify **accel_system_id** and **validate_timestamps**.
Other is compatible.

==== New Constants ====
None.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
If there are any php.ini settings then list: 
  * opcache.allow_direct_exec_opcode
    * if set 0, default value, same as the current state, can not direct exec any opcode file
    * if set 1, only when opcode file start is **<?phpo**, direct exec opcode file without php source file
  * opcache.prohibit_different_version_opcode
    * set 1, default value, different version opcode file exec are prohibited
    * set 0, different version opcode file will report **E_WARNING** message

===== Future Scope =====
support opcode file in phar.
