  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>, George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>, Máté Kocsis <kocsismate@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionality in PHP 8.1 and remove it in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in the Proposal section:

  * ''date_sunrise()'' and ''date_sunset()''
  * ''key()'', ''current()'', ''next()'', ''prev()'', and ''reset()'' on objects
  * ''mb_check_encoding()'' without argument
  * ''get_class()'', ''get_parent_class()'' and ''get_called_class()'' without argument
  * ''FILE_BINARY'' and ''FILE_TEXT'' constants
  * ''t'' fopen mode
  * Passing bool for ''$amountOrUpOrDown'' argument of ''IntlCalendar::roll()''
  * Accessing static members on traits
  * ''strptime()''
  * ''strftime()'' and ''gmtstrftime()''
  * ''mhash*()'' function family
  * ''ctype_*()'' function family accepts ''int'' parameters
  * Return by reference with void type
  * NIL constant defined by the IMAP extension
  * Calling overloaded pgsql functions without the connection argument

===== Proposal =====

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a 2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.1 and removal in PHP 9.0.

==== date_sunrise() and date_sunset() ====

These two functions have the signature:

<PHP>
function date_sunset(
    int $timestamp,
    int $format = SUNFUNCS_RET_STRING,
    float $latitude = ini_get("date.default_latitude"),
    float $longitude = ini_get("date.default_longitude"),
    float $zenith = ini_get("date.sunset_zenith"),
    float $gmt_offset = 0
): mixed;
</PHP>

This function depends on ini settings that specify the "default" latitude and longitude, a concept that makes very little sense. Additionally it requires familiarity with appropriate zenith values to use for different purposes.

''date_sunset()'' and ''date_sunrise()'' have since been superseded by ''date_sun_info()'':

<PHP>
function date_sun_info(int $time, float $latitude, float $longitude): array;
</PHP>

This function does not use "default" latitude and longitude, and returns an associative array of multiple different definitions of the sunrise/sunset concept.

The proposal is to deprecate ''date_sunset()'' and ''date_sunrise()'' in favor of ''date_sun_info()''. The ini settings ''date.default_latitude'', ''date.default_longitude'' and ''date.sunset_zenith'' are marked as deprecated in the documentation. In the next major version, both the functions and the ini settings will be removed.
This was initially discussed in: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4423.

==== key(), current(), next(), prev(), reset() on objects ====

The ''key()'' family of functions, which are used to manipulate the internal array pointer, also accept objects. In this case they work on the mangled property table. That is, using ''key()'' and friends on an object is essentially the same as using them on ''get_mangled_object_vars($object)''.

This catches many people off guard, because they expect ''key()'' etc. to integrate with the iterator interface. That is, if the passed object implements ''Iterator'' then ''key($object)'' should perform an ''$object->key()'' call. The water here have been further muddied by ''ArrayObject'', which prior to PHP 7.4 was the only object where ''key()'' etc. //did// effectively integrate with the iterator interface.

There are principally two ways to resolve this: The first is to deprecate the use of ''key()'' etc on objects, and instead require people to perform an explicit ''(array)'' cast or ''get_mangled_object_vars()'' call beforehand. The other is to actually make these functions integrate with iterators. The issue I see with the latter is that we would only be able to support the ''Iterator'' interface proper, but not general ''Traversable''s: For these ''IteratorAggregate::getIterator()'', or the internal ''get_iterator()'' handler need to be called once at the start, which is not possible through the array iteration interface, as it consists of multiple independent functions. Additionally, the ''prev()'' function cannot be implemented for iterators.

As such, the proposal is to deprecate key(), current(), next(), prev() and reset() on objects. The suggested replacement is to cast the object to array first, or call ''get_mangled_object_vars()'', depending on what the intention is.

==== mb_check_encoding() without argument ====

The ''mb_check_encoding()'' usually accepts a string and an encoding, but can also be called without arguments. The documentation says:

> If it is omitted, this function checks all the input from the beginning of the request. 

The implementation says:

<code>
/* FIXME: Actually check all inputs, except $_FILES file content. */
if (MBSTRG(illegalchars) == 0) {
    RETURN_TRUE;
}
RETURN_FALSE;
</code>

This %%FIXME%% does not induce a sense of confidence in this function...

Further research shows that the documentation is correct, in that //any// encoding checking or conversion functionality invoked during a request will increment ''MBSTRG(illegalchars)''. As such, ''mb_check_encoding()'' tells you whether any illegal encoding has been encountered at any point. My best guess is that this was intended to be used in conjunction with the ''encoding_translation'' feature, which "treats" incoming SAPI data.

Overall this functionality is confusing, and the implementation is unfinished or broken. There are no calls to ''mb_check_encoding()'' without argument in popular composer packages.

The proposal is to deprecate calling ''mb_check_encoding()'' without arguments.

==== get_class(), get_parent_class() and get_called_class() without argument ====

In PHP 7.2, [[rfc:get_class_disallow_null_parameter|passing null to ''get_class()'']] was forbidden, because this behavior was very bug prone. However, the ability to call ''get_class()'' without argument was retained. In that case ''get_class()'' is approximately the same as ''self::class''. ''get_parent_class()'' exhibits the same behavior.

The proposal is to deprecate argument-less ''get_class()'', ''get_parent_class()'' and ''get_called_class()'' in favor of the dedicated ''self::class'', ''parent::class'' and ''static::class'' syntax, which was introduced in PHP 5.5. (''get_called_class()'' only has an argument-less form, so it would be deprecated entirely.)

As a caveat, if ''get_parent_class()'' is used to check whether the class has a parent, it is necessary to use ''get_parent_class(self::class)'' instead, because ''parent::class'' will generate an error if used inside a class without parent.

==== FILE_BINARY and FILE_TEXT constants ====

These were introduced in PHP 5.2.7 for forward compatibility with PHP 6, but don't have any effect. These constants are especially confusing because ''fopen()'' supports ''b'' (binary) and ''t'' (text) modes, which //do// have an effect, but a completely unrelated one.

The proposal is to deprecate the ''FILE_BINARY'' and ''FILE_TEXT'' constants.

This was pointed out in: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5556

==== "t" fopen mode ====

Next to the standard modes, fopen also accepts ''t'' and ''b'' modes, which are only meaningful on Windows. When ''b'' is used (which is the default), the file is treated as usual. If ''t'' is specified, automatic conversion between LF and CRLF line endings is performed. The documentation says:

> Again, for portability, it is also strongly recommended that you re-write code that uses or relies upon the 't' mode so that it uses the correct line endings and 'b' mode instead. 

The proposal is to deprecate the use of ''t'' mode in fopen(). Explicitly specifying the ''b'' mode remains supported.

There is a complication here: While ''fopen()'' itself defaults to binary mode, some other functions like ''proc_open()'' on pipe descriptors still default to text mode. It is not clear what should be done with these functions.

==== Passing bool for $amountOrUpOrDown argument of IntlCalendar::roll() ====

<php>IntlCalendar::roll()</php> accepts an integer which specifies how much to add to a given field. The integer can be negative to subtract.

However, it also accepts a boolean argument, in which case ''true'' is interpreted as ''1'' and ''false'' is interpreted as ''-1''. This does not appear to be actually useful for anything, makes for a confusing function signature, and violates PHP's usual type coercion rules.

The proposal is to deprecate passing a boolean to this method argument.

==== Accessing static members on traits ====

Currently, it is possible to directly access static trait members, rather than accessing them on the class using the trait:

<PHP>
trait T {
    public static $foo;
}
class C {
    use T;
}
var_dump(T::$foo); // Allowed.
</PHP>

This is conceptually wrong, and causes various complications. For example, the meaning of ''self'' is ill-defined (which normally refers to the using class, not the trait), the behavior of static variables in methods may change depending on whether a trait method has been called prior to being used, and opcache preloading requires constant initializers in traits to be fully resolved (as they may be used directly).

There is a somewhat dated analysis of projects using this "feature" at https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/4829#issuecomment-542224541.

The proposal is to deprecate the ability to access static properties and static methods directly on traits.

==== strptime() ====

The ''strptime()'' function parses a date/time string into an array. However, this function is not supported on Windows, and the manual further warns:

> Internally, this function calls the strptime() function provided by the system's C library. This function can exhibit noticeably different behaviour across different operating systems. The use of date_parse_from_format(), which does not suffer from these issues, is recommended on PHP 5.3.0 and later.

Notably, distributions like alpine that use musl instead of glibc may exhibit unexpected behavior.

As the note already mentioned, ''date_parse_from_format()'' is an alternative that is always available and always behaves consistently. ''DateTime::createFromFormat()'' is another alternative that creates a ''DateTime'' object instead. ''IntlDateFormatter::parse()'' is available as a more sophisticated, localization-aware alternative.

The proposal is to deprecate the ''strptime()'' function in favor of portable alternatives.

==== strftime() and gmstrftime() ====

The ''strftime()'' and ''gmstrftime()'' functions exhibit similar issues as ''strptime()'', in that the formats they support, as well as their behavior, is platform-dependent. Unlike ''strptime()'', these functions are available on Windows, though with a different feature set than on Linux. Musl-based distributions like Alpine do not support timezone-related format specifiers correctly.

Once again ''DateTime::format()'' provides a portable alternative, and ''IntlDateFormatter::format()'' provides a more sophisticated, localization-aware alternative.

The proposal is to deprecate ''strftime()'' and ''gmstrftime()'' in favor of these alternatives.

==== mhash*() function family ====

''mhash*()'' functions were integrated into ext/hash in PHP 5.3 as a compatibility layer for ext/mhash (which has been removed in PHP 7.0). Unlike the ''hash_*()'' functions, the ''mhash*'' functions are not always available, and have to be separately enabled when configuring PHP.

The proposal is to deprecate ''mhash()'', ''mhash_keygen_s2k()'', ''mhash_count()'', ''mhash_get_block_size()'' and ''mhash_get_hash_name()'' in favor of the standard ext/hash functionality.

==== ctype_*() function family accepts int parameters ====

Next to strings, the ''ctype_*()'' functions also accept integers, with semantics described by this note in the manual:

<blockquote>
If an integer between -128 and 255 inclusive is provided, it is interpreted as the ASCII value of a single character (negative values have 256 added in order to allow characters in the Extended ASCII range). Any other integer is interpreted as a string containing the decimal digits of the integer.
</blockquote>

This is a common cause for confusion, especially when passing integer values to ''ctype_digit()''. ''ctype_digit(5)'' will return false, while ''ctype_digit("5")'' will return true. This violates the general principle that integral strings and integers should behave consistently.

Support for similar behavior in the ''strpos()'' family of functions has already been removed in PHP 8. If an ASCII codepoint should be checked, then it needs to be converted into a string explicitly using ''chr()''.

The proposal is to deprecate passing of non-strings to ''ctype_*()'' functions. In the next major versions, ''ctype_*()'' will be changed to accept a string parameter under standard semantics.

==== Return by reference with void type ====

It is currently possible to declare functions that return void by reference:

<PHP>
function &test(): void {}
</PHP>

This is contradictory, as void functions are not supposed to have a return value. Calling such a function will always result in a "Only variable references should be returned by reference" notice once it returns.

The proposal is to throw a compile-time deprecation for function signatures using by-reference returns in conjunction with void.

==== NIL constant defined by the IMAP extension ====

The ''NIL'' constant corresponds to the value ''0'', and can be confused with ''null''.

The proposal is to deprecate this constant.

==== Calling overloaded pgsql functions without the connection argument ====

ext/pgsql has a few overloaded functions which can be called without providing
the connection as the first argument. An example for this is the ''pg_query()'' function:

<PHP>
/**
 * @param resource|string $connection
 * @return resource|false
 */
function pg_query($connection, string $query = UNKNOWN) {}
</PHP>

If only 1 argument is passed, the function will use the default connection to execute the query.

We suggest to deprecate calling these functions without providing the connection.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

For PHP 8.1 additional deprecation notices will appear. For PHP 9.0 the previously deprecated functionality will no longer be available.

===== Removed from this proposal =====

The following entries were originally added to this proposal and then dropped.

==== DateTimeInterface::ISO8601 ====

The documentation says:

> Note: This format is not compatible with ISO-8601, but is left this way for backward compatibility reasons. Use DateTime::ATOM or DATE_ATOM for compatibility with ISO-8601 instead. 

There's a number of bug reports related to this. From what I understand, the core problem here is not that the ISO8601 format is //wrong//, it's just one of multiple legal ISO-8601 formats. As DateTime formats always refer to a specific format, not a set of multiple possible ones, there doesn't seem to be anything actionable here.

==== get_browser() function ====

This was originally included on the rationale that ''get_browser()'' is much slower than userland browscap implementations. However, this is no longer the case since a PHP 7.0 patch release, see https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2242.

==== DatePeriod::__construct() ====

This is a heavily overloaded function (it has 3 signatures) which should be deprecated in favor of 3 factory methods. However, those factory methods need to be introduced first, before the constructor can be deprecated.

==== Passing a method name as the first parameter to ReflectionMethod::__construct() ====

''%%ReflectionMethod::__construct()%%'' currently also accepts a single argument of the form ''"ClassName::methodName"'', as opposed to the class and method name being passed separately. A ''ReflectionMethod::fromMethodName()'' method should be added as a replacement. The replacement should be added before this overload can be deprecated.

==== unserialize_callback_func INI setting ====

This ini setting is currently still used (by Symfony for example) to throw an exception if a class is not found, instead of creating an instance of ''__PHP_Incomplete_Class''. We should introduce an unserialize option that achieves this before the deprecate the ini setting.

==== Predefined variable $http_response_header ====

The [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.httpresponseheader.php|''$http_response_header'']] variable is magically created in the local scope whenever an HTTP request is performed through PHP's stream layer. Creating a variable in the local scope is a terrible way of returning additional information, and we have removed all other features using this operating principle, such as ''$php_errormsg''.

It is possible to replace ''$http_response_header'' by making use of stream wrapper metadata. However, this means that you cannot simply use ''file_get_contents()'' anymore, and need to drop down to the stream layer:

<PHP>
// Replace:
$url = 'https://example.org';
$response = file_get_contents($url);
$headers = $http_response_header;

// With:
$url = 'https://example.org';
$f = fopen($url, 'r');
$reponse = stream_get_contents($f);
$headers = stream_get_meta_data($f)['wrapper_data'];
</PHP>

Things become more complicated once you want to access headers of a request that failed. In this case, stream meta data will not be available, as the ''fopen()'' call will fail. Instead, it is necessary to set the ''ignore_errors'' option:

<PHP>
$url = 'https://example.org/file_not_found';
$context = stream_context_create([
    'http' => [
        'ignore_errors' => true,
    ],
]);
$f = fopen($url, 'r', context: $context);
$response = stream_get_contents($f);
$headers = stream_get_meta_data($fp)['wrapper_data'];
</PHP>

This also means that you now manually need to detect whether the request failed based on the headers.

These alternatives are workable, but also not great. Possibly we should add a function that returns the last response headers, instead of creating a variable?
