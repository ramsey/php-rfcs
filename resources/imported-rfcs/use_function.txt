====== PHP RFC: Importing namespaced functions ======

===== Introduction =====

PHP offers the ability to import namespaces and types (classes/interfaces/traits) via the **use** statement. This capability however does not exist for functions. As a result, working with namespaced functions is rather cumbersome.

A function can only be referenced without fully qualifying it, if the calling code is in the same namespace as the function:

<code php>
namespace foo\bar {
    function baz() {
        return 'foo.bar.baz';
    }
}

namespace foo\bar {
    function qux() {
        return baz();
    }
}

namespace {
    var_dump(foo\bar\qux());
}
</code>

It is possible to avoid fully qualifying the name by importing the namespace that the function is defined in. But that namespace must still be referenced when calling the function:

<code php>
namespace foo\bar {
    function baz() {
        return 'foo.bar.baz';
    }
}

namespace {
    use foo\bar as b;
    var_dump(b\baz());
}
</code>

You cannot import the function directly. PHP does not currently support that.

===== Proposal =====

The proposal is to combine existing keywords to a new sequence that allows importing functions into a namespace. This should make namespaced functions less of a pain to use and discourage placing them in the global namespace.

Since functions and classes are in separate namespaces, it is not feasible to use the **use** keyword for both, as it would likely result in conflicts and overhead.

Instead of introducing a new keyword, it would be possible to combine **use** and **function** to a sequence. This new **use function** combo would work as follows:

<code php>
namespace foo\bar {
    function baz() {
        return 'foo.bar.baz';
    }
    function qux() {
        return baz();
    }
}

namespace {
    use function foo\bar\baz, foo\bar\qux;
    var_dump(baz());
    var_dump(qux());
}
</code>

All of this applies not only to functions, but also to namespaced constants. For consistency, a **use const** sequence should also be introduced, that does the same thing for constants:

<code php>
namespace foo\bar {
    const baz = 42;
}

namespace {
    use const foo\bar\baz;
    var_dump(baz);
}
</code>

Just like classes, it should be possible to alias imported functions and constants:

<code php>
namespace {
    use function foo\bar as foo_bar;
    use const foo\BAZ as FOO_BAZ;
    var_dump(foo_bar());
    var_dump(FOO_BAZ);
}
</code>

===== General questions & answers =====

==== Why not just import a namespace? ====

While it's true that you can import a namespace and alias it to a single character, this is not necessary for classes, so it makes no sense to require it for functions.

There are two specific use cases where importing a function can significantly improve the readability of code.

=== Tiny libraries ===

Libraries which are just collections of functions can benefit from this. They can be namespaced under (for example) the author's name, e.g. `igorw\compose()`. This prevents namespace clashes.

The users of that function don't care about who the author is, they just want `compose()`. They don't want to invent a new meaningless alias just to use the function.

=== Domain specific languages ===

Functions can be treated as an extension of the language, or to be used to create a custom meta-language. An example of this is building a HTML tree, but this could be anything, really.

A HTML building DSL:

<code php>
use function html\div, html\p, html\em;

$html = div(p('Some', em('Text')));
</code>

Avoiding noise and clutter is really important to make this usable and readable.

==== Global namespace fallback ====

Currently PHP will search for functions in the local namespace first, then fall back to the global one. For functions imported by a **use function** statement, there should be
no fallback.

<code php>
namespace foo\bar {
    function strlen($str) {
        return 4;
    }
}

namespace {
    use function foo\bar\strlen;
    use function foo\bar\non_existent;
    var_dump(strlen('x'));
    var_dump(non_existent());
}
</code>

The call to **strlen** is no longer ambiguous. **non_existent** is no longer looked up in the global namespace.

==== Why is "use function" needed instead of just "use"? ====

In PHP, functions and classes are stored in separate namespaces. A function `foo\bar` and a class `foo\bar` can co-exist, because it is possible to infer from the context if the symbol is used as a class or a function:

<code php>
namespace foo {
    function bar() {}
    class bar {}
}

namespace {
    foo\bar(); // function call
    new foo\bar(); // class instantiation
    foo\bar::baz(); // static method call on class
}
</code>

If **use** were changed to support functions as well, it would introduce BC breaks.

An example:

<code php>
namespace {
    function bar() {}
}

namespace foo {
    function bar() {}
}

namespace {
    use foo\bar;
    bar();
}
</code>

The behaviour changed, when **use** was changed. Depending on your PHP version, a different function will be called.
