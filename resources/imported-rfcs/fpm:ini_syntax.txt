====== Request for Comments: FPM INI Syntax ======
  * Version: 1.0

This RFC discusses the FPM configuration file syntax and it's replacement from XML to INI.

===== Introduction =====

FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is under discussion for its inclusion into the PHP core distribution. See the [[rfc/fpm|RFC]].

Until now, FPM uses a XML configuration file. It's been discussed several times with passion:
  * http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=126936264101067&w=2
  * http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=126021179101625&w=2

But it comes that we <del>almost</del> all agree to change it to INI. This RFC propose a INI syntax for FPM.

===== Requirements =====
  * An include directive to include one or several files at once. This directive can be set everywhere in the configuation files.
  * A global section which include global simple directives (pid_file=, ...)
  * At least one **worker** section wich includes:
    * specific simple directives (user=, group=, status=, ...)
    * specific array directives (environment[PATH]=, php_define[sendmail_path]=, ...)
  * A reference system. A worker can be set as a reference and it'll never be instantiated. Classic workers can use it to define default values. For exemple, timeout directives are set once in a reference worker and normal workers will use this worker as a reference.

===== Implementation =====
I propose to implement the previous requirements this way:
  * The include directive is a simple key/value. The key is named **include**. The value is a pattern recognized by [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/manpage?3+glob|glob(3)]]. With glob(3), a simple file can be set, but also a bunch of file at once<code>include=/etc/fpm.d/www.my.site.com.conf
include=/etc/fpm.d/*.conf</code>
  * The global section can start with an INI section named globals. This INI section is not mandatory if directives are set before any other INI sections. <code>[globals]</code>
  * Simple directive values are simple key/value pairs.<code>daemonize = yes</code>
  * Array directive values are arrays of key/value pairs.<code>environment[PATH] = /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
php_define[sendmail_path] = /bin/mini_sendmail -t -i -fwww@my.site.com</code>
  * Workers starts with a INI section. The value of the section is named with the worker's name. All the following directives are related to this worker until another INI section starts a new worker.<code>[www.my.site.com]</code>
    * The directive **is_a_reference** set the current worker as a reference. It can be set to yes or no. <code>is_a_reference=yes   ; incompatible with reference</code>
    * The directive **reference** set the worker to use as a reference. It's named **reference** and can be set to any worker set as a reference by **is_a_reference**. <code>reference=default   ; incompatible with is_a_reference</code>

===== Yet known directives =====
==== Global directives ====
  * **daemonize**. Set to yes/no. Default to yes. Does FPM run as a standalone daemon or stays in foreground (debugging purpose).
  * **pid_file**. Set to PID file location.
  * **error_log**. Set to error file location.
  * **log_level**. Set the log_level: notice, warn, error or alert.
  * **process_control_timeout**. Set a time value.
  * **emergency_restart_interval**. Set a time value.
  * **emergency_restart_threshold**. Set a time value.

==== Worker directives ====
  * **user**.
  * **group**.
  * **pm.style**.
  * **pm.dynamic.start_servers**.
  * **pm.dynamic.min_spare_servers**.
  * **pm.dynamic.max_spare_servers**.
  * **pm.max_children**.
  * **listen_address**.
  * **listen.backlog**.
  * **listen.owner**.
  * **listen.group**.
  * **listen.mode**.
  * **status**.
  * **ping**.
  * **pong**.
  * **php_define[]**.
  * **chroot**.
  * **chdir**.
  * **allowed_clients**.
  * **environment[]**.
  * **request_terminate_timeout**.
  * **request_slowlog_timeout**.
  * **slowlog**.
  * **rlimit_core**.
  * **rlimit_files**.
  * **max_requests**.
  * **catch_worker_output**.
===== Not yet known directives =====
  * **include**.
  * **reference**.
  * **is_a_reference**.
===== Rename directive proposal =====
In this section, I want to propose to rename some of the yet know directives.
  * **pm.style** to **pm[mode]**. Set process manager directives into an array. Rename also style in mode which is more understandable, I think.
  * **pm.dynamic.start_servers** to **pm[start_servers]**. As start_servers is only used with dynamic mode, it's not necessary to precise it's dynamic.
  * **pm.dynamic.min_spare_servers** to **pm[min_spare_servers]**. Same as start_servers.
  * **pm.dynamic.max_spare_servers** to **pm[max_spare_servers]**. Same as start_servers.
  * **pm.max_children** to **pm[max_children]**.
  * **status** to **pm[status]**. The status directive is directly related to PM as it's its status page.
  * Set listen directives as an array, like PM:
    * **listen[address]**
    * **listen[backlog]**
    * **listen[user]**
    * **listen[group]**
    * **listen[mode]**
  * **ping** and **pong** to a ping array:
    * **ping[path]** to set the ping path request (/ping)
    * **ping[response]** to set the response from the previous request
  * **max_requests** to **pm[max_requests]**. Move this directive to the PM array as it's directly related to PM.
  * **environment[]** to **env[]**. The short word env is enough to understand and closer to reality (env shell command).
  * **php_define[]** to **php_flag[]**, **php_value[]**, **php_admin_flag[]**, **php_admin_value[]**. This is the same syntax as the apache sapi.
  * **allowed_clients** to **allowed_client[]** as there could be more than one allowed client.

===== Proposal and Patch =====

I've started writting the patch. Work In progress.
