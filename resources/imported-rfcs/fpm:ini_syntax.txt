This RFC discusses the FPM configuration file syntax and it's replacement from XML to INI.

===== Introduction =====

FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is under discussion for its inclusion into the PHP core distribution. See the [[rfc/fpm|RFC]].

Until now, FPM uses a XML configuration file. It's been discussed several times with passion:
  * http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=126936264101067&w=2
  * http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=126021179101625&w=2

But it comes that we <del>almost</del> all agree to change it to INI. This RFC propose a INI syntax for FPM.

===== The requierements =====
  * An **include** directive to include one or several files at once
  * A **global** section which include global directives (pid file, ...)
