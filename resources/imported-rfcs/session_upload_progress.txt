===== Introduction =====

The file upload feature in PHP allows extensions to be called back on some events. A few extensions use this to implement some sort of upload progress feedback, but none of them are released with PHP, which makes this feature unusable in many environments.

==== Upload progress in sessions ====

The patch allows the session extension to hook into the file upload feature in order to provide upload progress information through session variables. These informations can be retrieved by a script while the upload is still in progress, allowing to provide feedback to the user.

Implementing this in the sessions extension makes this feature available to every one and makes the different storage backends available for this purpose.

The feature comes with some ini settings, working just like APC's ones:

  * session.upload_progress.enabled[=1] : Enables/disables the feature
  * session.upload_progress.cleanup[=1] : Cleanup progress data from session as soon as all post data has been read (recommended)
  * session.upload_progress.prefix[=upload_progress_] : Progress data will be stored in _SESSION[session.upload_progress.prefix . _POST[session.upload_progress.name]]
  * session.upload_progress.name[=PHP_SESSION_UPLOAD_PROGRESS] : If no _POST[session.upload_progress.name] is set, the feature will not be enabled
  * session.upload_progress.freq[=1%] : Update session data every session.upload_progress.freq bytes uploaded. If the value is postfixed with '%', it will be interpreted as a percentage of the total post content length.
  * session.upload_progress.min_freq[=1.0] : Minimum delay between updates, in seconds

When session.upload_progress.enabled is set to 1 and $_POST[session.upload_progress.name] is set and non-empty, upload informations are stored in $_SESSION[session.upload_progress.prefix . $_POST[session.upload_progress.name]]. Otherwise nothing will be done.

The session.upload_progress.freq and session.upload_progress.min_freq settings control how often the session data is updated. freq can be given in bytes (e.g. 100) or in percentage (e.g. 1%) of the size of the POST content length. min_freq is given in seconds (e.g. 0.5) and is the minimum interval between two updates. With a reasonable amount for these two settings, the feature has mostly no overhead.

The data stored in the session will looks like this:

<code php>
$_SESSION["upload_progress_123"] = array(
 "start_time" => 1234567890,   // The request time
 "content_length" => 57343257, // POST content length
 "bytes_processed" => 453489,  // Amount of bytes received and processed
 "done" => false,              // true when the POST handler has finished, successfully or not
 "files" => array(
  0 => array(
   "field_name" => "file1",       // Name of the <input/> field
   // The following 3 elements equals those in $_FILES
   "name" => "foo.avi",
   "tmp_name" => "/tmp/phpxxxxxx",
   "error" => 0,
   "done" => true,                // True when the POST handler has finished handling this file
   "start_time" => 1234567890,    // When this file has started to be processed
   "bytes_processed" => 57343250, // Amount of bytes received and processed for this file
  ),
  // An other file, not finished uploading, in the same request
  1 => array(
   "field_name" => "file2",
   "name" => "bar.avi",
   "tmp_name" => NULL,
   "error" => 0,
   "done" => false,
   "start_time" => 1234567899,
   "bytes_processed" => 54554,
  ),
 )
);
</code>

A simple form:

<code php>
<form action="upload.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
 <input type="hidden" name="<?php echo ini_get("session.upload_progress.name"); ?>" value="123" />
 <input type="file" name="file1" />
 <input type="file" name="file2" />
 <input type="submit" />
</form>
</code>

The current patch also allows to cancel an upload by setting the "cancel_upload" key to true in the progress data (e.g. $_SESSION["upload_progress_123"]["cancel_upload"] = true;).

Doing so will cancel the currently uploading file and bypass all remaining data (POST variables, uploads, etc). An upload canceled this way will have "error" set to [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.errors.php|UPLOAD_ERR_EXTENSION]].
