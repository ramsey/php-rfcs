====== PHP RFC: Lexical Scope Support for Anonymous Classes ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-04-19

===== Introduction =====
Anonymous classes are cumbersome to use because they lack support for lexical scope [use()].

If the anonymous class has dependencies, they must be injected via the constructor, which is verbose, repetitive, and widens the margin for error considerably.

===== Proposal =====
We allow anonymous classes to import variables into their property table using the familiar syntax.

The following syntax is used:

<code php>
new class [extends Parent] [implements Interface] [use(...)] {}
</code>

Where use is one or more variables, property references, or a references to either.

The following code:

<code php>
$glow = 5;
$foo = new class use($glow) {

};
</code>

Is functionally equivalent to:

<code php>
$glow = 5;
$foo = new class($glow) {
    public function __construct($glow) {
        $this->glow = $glow;
    }
    private $glow;
};
</code>

By default, imported variables shall be declared private members of the anonymous class unless the class declaration overrides this behaviour, as the following example shows:

<code php>
$glow = 5;
$foo = new class() use($glow) {
    public $glow;
};
</code>

References are also accepted, so that the following code:

<code php>
$glow = 5;
$foo = new class() use(&$glow) {

};
</code>

Is functionally equivalent to:

<code php>
$glow = 5;
$foo = new class($glow) {
    public function __construct(&$glow) {
       $this->glow =& $glow;
    }
    private $glow;
}; 
</code>

===== Syntax Choices =====

Placing the [use(...)] anywhere else in the class declaration seems to be confusing, the current position seems the obvious choice.

It has been suggested that it would be better to have [use(...)] on each function declaration. This would lead to a lot of repetition, and fragmented code that is more difficult to reason about.

The cognitive overhead of "anything use'd by the declaration is a member property" is almost nil.

===== Error Conditions =====

The same restrictions that apply to use() on function declarations apply:

  * Must not be superglobal name
  * Must not be ''$this''

The property reference must be well formed, and accessible in the lexical scope:

''$object->property''

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
What breaks, and what is the justification for it?

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
7.1

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Trivial changes for new opcodes and new sequences.

==== To Opcache ====
Will need adjustment, rather trivial (if you are Dmitry)

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
2/3 majority required, simple yes/no vote.
