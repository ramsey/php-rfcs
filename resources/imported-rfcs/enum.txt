===== Introduction =====

Enums are helpful when defining a finite set of strongly typed, mutually exclusive values.

===== Proposal =====

Enums are given a name and a finite set of unique, case-sensitive values:
<PHP>
enum RenewalAction {
    Deny,
    Approve
}
</PHP>

Enums are strongly typed and can be used as parameter or return types. They can also be used in case statements.
<PHP>
function other(RenewalAction $action): RenewalAction {
    switch ($action) {
        case RenewalAction::Approve:
            return RenewalAction::Deny;
            
        case RenewalAction::Deny:
            return RenewalAction::Approve;
    }
}
f(RenewalAction::Approve);
</PHP>

Each enum value knows its ordinal, or in other words each enum value knows its position that it was defined in. This can be retrieved with the ''ordinal()'' method:
<PHP>
var_dump(RenewalAction::Approve->ordinal()); // int(1)
var_dump(RenewalAction::Deny->ordinal()); // int(0)
</PHP>

An array of all values in the enum can be retrieved with the ''values()'' method. The order in which they are returned is the same as the order in which they are defined.
<PHP>
foreach (RenewalAction::values() as $name => $value) {
    printf("%s: %d\n", $name, $value->ordinal());
}
/* Result:
Deny: 0
Approve: 1
 */
</PHP>

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

The vote will be a simple "yes" or "no". This RFC requires 2/3 of the votes to be "yes" to pass. This RFC targets PHP version 7.1 .

===== Patches and Tests =====
