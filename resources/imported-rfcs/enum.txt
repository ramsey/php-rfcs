====== Request for Comments: Enum ======
// The old (Pierrick) version of the enum RFC can be found at https://wiki.php.net/rfc/enum?rev=1302087566 //

This RFC is about adding the enum language structure.

====== Introduction ======

When writing a program, it is often required to create lists of constants representing integers to make the code more readable. This RFC introduce a new language construct to define such a list by assigning unique arbitrary values or not.

==== Why do we need enum ====

Frequently developers need to produce code like this:
<code php>
const	LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG = 1,
	LOG_LEVEL_INFO = 2,
	LOG_LEVEL_WARNING = 3,
	LOG_LEVEL_ERROR = 4;

// Or

class Tokens {
	const	T_IF = 258,
		T_ELSE = 259,
		T_WHILE = 260,
		T_DO = 261;
}
</code>

The proposal is that this could be written in a much more concise manner:
<code php>
enum { 
	LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG,
	LOG_LEVEL_INFO,
	LOG_LEVEL_WARNING,
	LOG_LEVEL_ERROR 
};

// Or

class Tokens {
	enum { 
		T_IF = 258,
		T_ELSE,
		T_WHILE,
		T_DO 
	};
}
</code>
===== Proposal and Patch =====

Syntax: "enum" "{" name [ "=" intvalue ] [, name [ "=" intvalue ] ] ... "}"


Where : 

    - name is the name of the constant to define
    - intvalue is 
        - the value of this constant
        - if not defined the value will be the value of the previous defined constant in the same enum + 1
        - if there is no previous defined constant in the same enum the value will be one
