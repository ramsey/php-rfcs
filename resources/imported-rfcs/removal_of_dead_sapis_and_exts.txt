  * Author: Anatol Belski, <ab@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/removal_of_dead_sapis

===== Introduction =====

 Currently PHP contains many SAPIs to the servers either completely unavailable or unsupported for a long time. The corresponding list 

 Dead SAPIs:
  * aolserver
  * apache
  * apache_hooks
  * caudium
  * continuity
  * isapi
  * milter  
  * phttpd
  * pi3web
  * roxen
  * thttpd
  * tux
  * webjames
  * apache2filter - not really dead, but currently broken

 Maintained SAPIs:
  * apache2handler
  * cli
  * cgi
  * embed
  * fpm
  * litespeed
  * nsapi
  * phpdbg

 Extensions with unmaintained dependencies

  * imap
  * mcrypt

 Deprecated extensions handled by https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_deprecated_functionality_in_php7 (not handled by this RFC)

  * mysql
  * ereg

===== Research =====

==== sapi/aolserver ====

Server last release: 2012

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOLserver

==== sapi/apache ====

Server last release: 2010

Apache 1.x branch not developed anymore since 2010. Also it supports no security updates anymore. 

==== sapi/apache_hooks ====

Same as sapi/apache.

==== sapi/caudium ====

Server last release: 2012

The official documentation of Caudium states that PHP can only run as CGI or FCGI http://www.caudium.net/space/documentation/PHP%20Setup . Running PHP as a module is not supported anymore.

==== sapi/continuity ====

No mortal remains of the corresponding server could be found on the internets.

\\
Things required to be done for the final decisions:
  * research the author names
  * articulate the exact state of each dead SAPI
  * articulate the exact state and availability of the corresponding server
  * if possible and makes sense, check if the SAPIs compiles, even with very ancient but latest release of the server
  * check if there are packages supported by distros
  * notify the authors about a possible removal of the corresponding SAPI, wait for their response and include it for the final decision

This RFC crosses with https://wiki.php.net/rfc/size_t_and_int64 as removal of the dead SAPIs will exlude the need of their porting.

===== Proposal =====

SAPIs to be unconditionally removed: apache, apache_hooks, caudium, continuity

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

As the dead SAPIs are already dead, no BC breach is expected.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

7

===== SAPIs Impacted =====

Dead SAPI list in the description.

===== Impact to Existing Extensions =====

None.

===== php.ini Defaults =====

php.ini will have to be checked to remove the unavailable config options, if any.

===== Open Issues =====

None.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

None.

===== Future Scope =====

Should an SAPI come back, the corresponding code is available in the git history.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Remove dead SAPIs: yes/no

===== Patches and Tests =====

Links to any external patches and tests go here.

If there is no patch, make it clear who will create a patch, or whether a volunteer to help with implementation is needed.

Make it clear if the patch is intended to be the final patch, or is just a prototype.

===== Implementation =====

After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====

Links to external references, discussions or RFCs

===== Rejected Features =====

Keep this updated with features that were discussed on the mail lists.
