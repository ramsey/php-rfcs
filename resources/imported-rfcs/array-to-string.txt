===== Introduction =====

Currently, array to string zval conversion raises an E_NOTICE and returns a string
containing 'Array'.

This RFC considers this behavior as non-optimal and proposes improvements.

===== Proposal =====

As seen above, zval conversion from array to string, implicit or explicit, gives
E_NOTICE and 'Array'.

We consider this as no more than a temporary half-backed solution : we raise a low-level error
and we return a useless string.

Now, the release of a new major version is the occasion to make a definitve decision.

  Note: the RFC originally proposed, either to fully support the feature, or to deprecate it.
  Following discussion, it was decided to only propose the option of deprecating it.
  So the other option was removed, and can be consulted via older versions of the RFC.

==== 1st alternative: deprecate ====

Here, we consider that array-to-string conversion was never actively supported nor
encouraged, that, it most cases, its only effect is hiding bugs, and that it is time to disable it definitely.

Another argument is that there never was an agreement on the 'standard' way
to convert an array to a string.

So, we propose that Array-to-string conversions are considered exactly the same
as object-to-string with no '__toString' method:
any conversion attempt generates an E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR. Then,
if the program is still alive, the conversion returns 'Array' as before. The E_NOTICE
message is suppressed.
No more worries about hiding bugs with this logic, as masking such an error level is a strong
user decision, definitely not the same as disabling E_NOTICE.

We could go through a migration phase using E_DEPRECATED, but we consider
that, since an E_NOTICE is currently generated, it may be considered as a
deprecation notice, and we can directly switch to E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR.

Another argument is that, while this one should not be very problematic, it is
always better to introduce a BC break in a major version.

If 5.7 is revived, it will contain an interim version, with E_NOTICE replaced by E_DEPRECATED.

==== 2nd alternative: full support ====

  Removed

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

The potential BC breaks
are important because a lot of PHP code runs in E_NOTICE-disabled environments and
the 'Array' return value, while probably invalid, may easily go unnoticed.

In balance of this, we can consider that raising the error level in environments
where E_NOTICE messages are disabled, will generally help discovering bugs that had
remained unnoticed because the error level was hidden.

Actually, during the discussion, the opinions seemed to converge towards
the position that discovering undetected bugs is probably more important than
potential BC breaks.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
