====== Request for Comments: Namespace Issues ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2008-03-06
  * Author: Jochem Maas <jochem@iamjochem.com>
  * Status: Work in Progress
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/namespaces

===== Introduction =====

The purpose of this RFC is to document issues regarding the current namespace implementation, whether percieved or otherwise. 

==== Why this document ====

This document serves as summary of outstanding issues in order to aid discussion and resolution thereof.

==== Common Misconceptions ====

This document does not serve to force any particular changes in the engine regarding namespaces, as such any or all of the issues defined may at some stage 
be declared resolved without any implementation changes; It should accepted that some issues may only exist in so far that users have misinterpreted the
current namespace functionality.  

===== Issue Resolution =====

It is envisaged that all the issues raised in this document will be resolved in one of the following ways:

  - via functional changes to the current implementation
  - via the introduction of functional limitations (e.g. E_WARNING or E_FATAL errors) that alert php users to problems with there use of namespaces 
  - via user education, to this end a seperate document is being developed in order to define guidelines and 'best practices' with regard to namespaces (see: [[doc:scratchpad:namespaces]])


===== Issues =====

The following issues have been put forwards by various members of the php developers group and php users at large, the issues listed are in no particular order (this may change in the future):

**TODO! (I'm currently scouring the web/mailinglists for everything I can find) **

==== One namespace per file ====
currently one can only use one namespace per file, this is seen by some as an artificial limitation that forces some developers to change their project structures and as such breaks system that make use of (automated) source file concatenation (for performance reasons & distrubition), this is issue is being tackled in a seperate rfc and
won't be covered here. (see [[rfc:namespacecurlies]]) 
 
==== Using define() ====

==== Autoload & functions ====

==== Importing NameSpace::* ====

==== Importing functions ====

==== Name resolution order ====

==== Keywords in namespace names ====

==== Namespace must be first declaration in file ====

==== Namespaces aren't implemented like in ... ====
PHP is not <insert your favorite language here>. Granted this is not an issue, but some of you reading this probably need something to smile about after reading the items above!

===== Miscellaneous =====

  * An RFC discussing namespaces for internal classes exists (see: [[[rfc:namespaces-for-internal-classes]]])
  * A scratchpad document is being worked on to gather namespace 'best practices' which will hopefully be incorporated into the official manual at some stage (see: [[doc:scratchpad:namespaces]])
