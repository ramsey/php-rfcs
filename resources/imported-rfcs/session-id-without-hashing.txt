====== PHP RFC: Session ID without hashing ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-04-06
  * Author: Yasuo Ohgaki <yohgaki@ohgaki.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/session-id-without-hashing
 
===== Introduction =====
Since PHP 7, there is php_random_bytes() function. Session ID generation does not need hashing for secure session ID generation. Session module may simply convert random bytes to readable characters.

As a bonus, simple session generation performance increased 2X or more.

===== Proposal =====

Remove hash and RNG related codes and settings from session module.

  * session.hash_function
  * session.hash_bits_per_character
  * session.entropy_file
  * session.entropy_length

Add new config for session ID generation.

  * session.sid_length (Session ID string length. Default: 48)
  * session.sid_bits_per_character (Outstanding bits per char. Default: 5)

Changed default
  * session.use_strict_mode (0 to 1)

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None. session.sid_length, session.sid_bits_per_character may set to compatible value.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.1

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Session module

==== To Opcache ====
None

==== New Constants ====
None

==== php.ini Defaults ====
hardcoded default and php.ini-* default values are the same.

  * session.sid_length (Session ID string length. Default: 48)
  * session.sid_bits_per_character (Outstanding bits per char. Default: 5)
  * session.use_strict_mode (Default: 1)


===== Open Issues =====
None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
3rd party and user save handlers are unaffected.

===== Future Scope =====


===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This project requires a 2/3 majority.
