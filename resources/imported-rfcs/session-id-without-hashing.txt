===== Introduction =====
The objective of this RFC is session module code cleanup, remove unneeded code complexity and redundancy. 

  * Hash function is not required to generate session ID with CSPRNG.
  * Hash function removal results in less number of INI config.

NOTE: It is meaningless applying hash to CS safe random bytes.

Since PHP 7, there is php_random_bytes() function. Session ID generation does not need hashing for secure session ID generation. Session module may simply convert random bytes to readable characters.

As a bonus, simple session generation performance increased 2X or more.

===== Proposal =====

Use php_random_bytes() generated binary random value directly and convert it to session ID by using session internal bin_to_readable() function.

Remove hash and RNG related codes and settings from session module.

  * session.hash_function
  * session.hash_bits_per_character
  * session.entropy_file
  * session.entropy_length

Add new config for session ID generation.

  * session.sid_length (Session ID string length. Default: 48 or 32)
  * session.sid_bits_per_character (Outstanding bits per char. Default: 5 or 4)

Default INI setting is vote option. session.sid_length=48 and session.sid_bits_per_character=5 is stronger, but BC. session.sid_length=32 and session.sid_bits_per_character=4 is weaker, but no BC.

NOTE: New session ID is far less likely to have collisions. Even if system has broken CSPRNG, session module has session ID collision detection already.

Min/max length of session ID: 22 - 256 (22 is the same length as MD5 hash with_hash_bits_per_chars=6)

===== Discussions =====

==== Exposing PRNG state has risk ====

If PRNG has vulnerability that generates predictable value, exposing raw PRNG state helps attackers. Although, this is unlikely with modern PRNGs, but risk is there. 

To mitigate risk, additional bytes (+60 bytes) are read from PRNG. Additional bytes should be good enough for predictable session ID with broken PRNG implementation. Those who are concerned PRNG quality, you may choose new INI defaults. Those who are comfortable with PRNG quality and values compatibility, you may choose compatible(old) INI defaults. 

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None, when compatible default is chosen

  * session.sid_length=32
  * session.sid_bits_per_character=4

If non-compatible default is chosen, session.sid_length, session.sid_bits_per_character may set to compatible value. 

  * session.sid_length=48
  * session.sid_bits_per_character=5

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.1

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Session module

==== To Opcache ====
None

==== New Constants ====
None

==== php.ini Defaults ====
hardcoded default and php.ini-* default values are the same. This is voting option.

  * session.sid_length (Session ID string length. Default: 48 or 32)
  * session.sid_bits_per_character (Outstanding bits per char. Default: 5 or 4)

===== Open Issues =====
None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
3rd party and user save handlers are unaffected.

===== Future Scope =====

Please select preferred default options. If number of votes are even, compatible(No BC break) options are used.

  * New defaults: session.sid_length=48, session.sid_bits_per_character=5 (240 bits session ID. BC break)
  * New defaults: session.sid_length=32, session.sid_bits_per_character=4 (128 bits session ID. No BC break)
