===== Introduction =====
The objective of this RFC is session module code cleanup, remove unneeded code complexity and redundancy. 

  * Hash function is not required to generate session ID with CSPRNG.
  * Hash function removal results in less number of INI config.

NOTE: It is meaningless applying hash to CS safe random bytes.

Since PHP 7, there is php_random_bytes() function. Session ID generation does not need hashing for secure session ID generation. Session module may simply convert random bytes to readable characters.

As a bonus, simple session generation performance increased 2X or more.

===== Proposal =====

Use php_random_bytes() generated binary random value directly and convert it to session ID by using session internal bin_to_readable() function.

Remove hash and RNG related codes and settings from session module.

  * session.hash_function
  * session.hash_bits_per_character
  * session.entropy_file
  * session.entropy_length

Add new config for session ID generation.

  * session.sid_length (Session ID string length. Default: 48)
  * session.sid_bits_per_character (Outstanding bits per char. Default: 5)

NOTE: New session ID is far less likely to have collisions. Even if system has broken CSPRNG, session module has session ID collision detection already.

Min/max length of session ID: 22 - 256 (22 is the same length as MD5 hash with_hash_bits_per_chars)

<del>Changed default</del>
  * <del>session.use_strict_mode (0 to 1) - Changed as insurance of broken PRNG implementation.</del>


===== Discussions =====

==== Exposing PRNG state has risk ====

If PRNG has vulnerability that generates predictable value, exposing raw PRNG state helps attackers. Although, this is unlikely with modern PRNGs, but risk is there. 

To mitigate risk, additional bytes (+60 bytes) are read from PRNG. Additional bytes should be good enough for predictable session ID with broken PRNG implementation.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

None. session.sid_length, session.sid_bits_per_character may set to compatible value. Default is incompatible to older versions, if you need session ID string compatibility set INI to

  * session.sid_length=32 (Session ID string length. Default: 48)
  * session.sid_bits_per_character=4 (Outstanding bits per char. Default: 5)

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.1

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
None

==== To Existing Extensions ====
Session module

==== To Opcache ====
None

==== New Constants ====
None

==== php.ini Defaults ====
hardcoded default and php.ini-* default values are the same.

  * session.sid_length (Session ID string length. Default: 48)
  * session.sid_bits_per_character (Outstanding bits per char. Default: 5)


===== Open Issues =====
None

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
3rd party and user save handlers are unaffected.

===== Future Scope =====
