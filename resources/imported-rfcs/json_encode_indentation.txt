====== PHP RFC: json_encode indentation ======
  * Version: 1.0
  * Date: 2021-06-03
  * Author: Timon de Groot, tdegroot96@gmail.com
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7093
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
Programs can serialize data to JSON using the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php|json_encode]] function. The function is widely used for generating JSON responses or payload over HTTP. Currently, it's not possible to tell json_encode what indentation level (2 spaces, 4 spaces, etc.) should be used when using the //JSON_PRETTY_PRINT// option. When generating JSON files which can be used/read/edited by users, indentation starts to become a relevant topic.

===== Proposal =====
Introducing a 4th parameter, called //indent//. The type of the parameter is string|int and its default value is 4.

When a string is passed, that character sequence will be used for indentation, where it normally would be '    ' (4 spaces). Users passing a string must be aware that usage of invalid JSON characters in the indentation value will natually cause invalid formatted JSON data.

When an int is passed, an indentation of N spaces will be applied.

<code php>
$data = [
    'key' => 4,
    'other_key' => [2]
];

echo json_encode(['behavior' => 'default'], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT) . PHP_EOL;
echo json_encode($data, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT, 512, 2) . PHP_EOL;
echo json_encode(['unicode' => "supported"], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT, 512, '🚀🚀') . PHP_EOL;
echo json_encode(['tabs' => "better"], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT, 512, "\t") . PHP_EOL;

?>
</code>

<code json>
{
    "behavior": "default"
}
{
  "key": 4,
  "other_key": [
    2
  ]
}
{
🚀🚀"unicode": "supported"
}
{
	"tabs": "better"
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The only breaking change this could cause is when programs are already passing a fourth parameter by accident.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
  * next PHP 8.x

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
Normal usage (as opposed to what is described in BIC) of the json_encode function will not be affected, as the default of 4 spaces will still be in effect.

===== Patches and Tests =====
Tests are written with the RFC
