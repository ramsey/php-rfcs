===== Introduction =====

As we move towards PHP 7.0.0, we must look at the current state of cryptography in PHP. Libmcrypt hasn't been touched in eight years (last release was in 2007), leaving openssl as the only viable option for PHP 5.x and 7.0 users. Meanwhile, ext/libsodium has been available in PECL for a while now, and has reached stability.

Libsodium is a modern cryptography library that offers authenticated encryption, high-speed elliptic curve cryptography, and much more. I maintain the documentation at 

===== Proposal =====

We should include the libsodium extension in the PHP core in a future release of PHP 7, preferably 7.1.0.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
An ideal target date would be 7.1.0

===== RFC Impact =====

==== New Constants ====
All new constants will be contained within the Sodium class in the global namespace. (See the list in the references section.)
