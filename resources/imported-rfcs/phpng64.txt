====== PHP RFC: 64 bit platform improvements for PHP-NG ======
  * Version: 0.9
  * Date: 2014-05-20
  * Author: Nikita Popov <nikic@php.net>
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

This RFC describes the decisions reached regarding improved 64bit support, following the discussion of the previous [[rfc:size_t_and_int64_next]] RFC.

===== Proposal =====

The 64bit changes described in the following will be added to the phpng branch **once it is more stable**.

The following changes **will** be made:

  * 64bit integers (in zvals and related areas) will be used on Win64 and other LLP64 platforms. This means that many current uses of ''long'' will be replaced with a type like ''zend_long'' which is 64bit large on all 64bit platforms.
  * ''size_t'' will be used for string lengths in ''zend_string''. This means that string sizes will be 64bit on 64bit platforms.
  * 64bit sizes/integers may be used in some other places as well, as long as the usage does not significantly increase memory usage. E.g. file/stream offsets and ini settings like ''memory_limit'' should support 64bit numbers.

The following changes will **not** be made:

  * Use of ''size_t'' for all lengths. In particular hashtables will always use 32bit lengths. Line numbers will be stored in a 32bit type. Special names (like argument or class names) will also use 32bit lengths, where possible.

The expected memory impact of these changes is around 1%. We are okay with that.

Unclear as of now: Will we be performing renames like ''IS_LONG'' to ''IS_INT'' along the way? I prefer not (Nikita).

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Do you agree that 64bit platform improvements as described above should be implemented?
