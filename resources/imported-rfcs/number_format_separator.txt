====== PHP RFC: Number Format Separator ======
  * Version: 1
  * Date: 2015-12-19
  * Author: Thomas Punt, tpunt@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/number_format_separator

===== Introduction =====
This RFC seeks to add support for using separators in numerical literals in PHP.
<code php>
1_000_000; // versus 1000000
3.141_592; // versus 3.141592
0x025_612; // versus 0x025612
0b0010_1101; // versus 0b00101101
</code>


===== Proposal =====
This feature seeks to enable for underscores to be used within any numerical literal in PHP to promote readability. It does not include stringy numerics because of the BC breakage involved (support for these can be done in the next major version of PHP, if they're wanted).

The following semantics have been chosen:

Leading underscores are not allowed (due to conflicts with constant naming conventions):
<code php>
_1; // interpreted as a constant
</code>

Trailing underscores are not allowed (it would only decrease readability and would not be beneficial):
<code php>
1_; // PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected '_' (T_STRING) in ...
</code>

Adjacent underscores are not allowed (there are no benefits to this)
<code php>
1__000; // PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected '__000' (T_STRING) in
</code>

Underscores are not allowed around the period (.) for floats, around the 0x for hexadecimal numbers, or around the 0b for binary numbers (it would only decrease readability and would not be beneficial):
<code php>
100_.0; // PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected '_' (T_STRING) in...
100._01; // PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected '_01' (T_STRING) in...
0x_0123; // PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected 'x_0123' (T_STRING) in...
0b_0101; // PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected 'b_0101' (T_STRING) in...
</code>

Other than the aforementioned rules, underscores may be freely interspersed between digits:
<code php>
100_000;
10_0.0_112;
0b01_10_11_00;
</code>

The underscore has been chosen because of its wide usage in other languages for formatting numerical literals, including Java, Ruby, Elixir, etc.
