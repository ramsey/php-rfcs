====== PHP RFC: Number Format Separator ======
  * Version: 1
  * Date: 2015-12-19
  * Author: Thomas Punt, tpunt@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/number_format_separator


===== Introduction =====
Long numerical literals can be a source of poor readability in code. Take the following examples:
<code php>
// what number is this?
197823459;

// which number is greater?
97802345932 > 97802349532;

// are these numbers equal?
9803458239 === 9803457239;
</code>

These are difficult to read and difficult reason about. To ameliorate this issue, this RFC proposes the introduction of a digit separator in numerical literals. This will enable the examples above to be rewritten as:
<code php>
// what number is this?
197_823_459;

// which number is greater?
97_802_345_932 > 97_802_349_532;

// are these numbers equal?
9_803_458_239 === 9_803_457_239;
</code>


===== Proposal =====
This RFC will add support for using the underscore character as a separator in PHP's numerical literals. The separator will be supported by all numerical types and notations in PHP.

Example:
<code php>
1_000_000; // versus 1000000
3.141_592; // versus 3.141592
0x02_56_12; // versus 0x025612
0b0010_1101; // versus 0b00101101
0267_3432; // versus 02673432
1_123.456_7e2 // versus 1123.4567e2
</code>

==== Chosen semantics ====

=== Disallow leading underscores ===

Leading underscores will not enhance readability and will conflict with constant naming conventions.
<code php>
_100; // a valid constant in PHP
</code>

=== Disallow trailing underscores ===

Trailing underscores will not enhance readability - if anything, they will decrease it.
<code php>
100_<=>1_000_+_CONST_NAME; // Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '_' (T_STRING)...
</code>

=== Disallow adjacent underscores ===

Allowing for two or more underscores to be placed together will provide no further readability benefits.
<code php>
1__000___000_000; // Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '__000___000_000' (T_STRING)...
</code>

=== Enable underscores between digits only ===

Underscores are not allowed around the period for floats, around the **0x** for hexadecimal notation, around the **0b** for binary notation, or around the **e** for scientific notation. This is because readability will be negatively impacted, and it doesn't really serve the purpose of a "digit separator."
<code php>
100_.0; // Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected '_' (T_STRING) in...
100._01; // Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected '_01' (T_STRING) in...
0x_0123; // Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected 'x_0123' (T_STRING) in...
0b_0101; // Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected 'b_0101' (T_STRING) in...
1_e2; // Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '_e2' (T_STRING)...
1e_2; // Parse error: syntax error, unexpected 'e_2' (T_STRING)...
</code>

=== Enable for arbitrary grouping of digits ===

Underscores may be freely interspersed between arbitrary groups of digits, enabling for developers to group the digits as they see fit. One such argument for relaxing the interspersing of underscores is that not all countries group digits in sets of three [1].
<code php>
1_234_567; // grouped in sets of 3
123_4567; // grouped in sets of 4 (Japan, China)
1_00_00_00_000; // grouped according to India's numbering system

0x11_22_33_44_55_66; // a number to be used as bytes, grouped by bytes
0x1122_3344_5566; // a number to be used as 16-bit data, grouped by word
</code>


==== Why the underscore character? ====

The underscore:
  * Is easy to type on the majority of keyboard layouts
  * Does not conflict with PHP's grammar
  * Acts as a clear and unambiguous delineator between digits (unlike the comma or period)

It has also been widely adopted as a digit separator in a number of other languages, including:
  * Ada
  * D
  * Java
  * Julia
  * Perl
  * C#
  * Ruby
  * Elixir

Few other languages have deviated from using the underscore to separate digits. One notable exception is C++, where it could not use an underscore because of conflicts with user-defined literals (specifically in a hexadecimal context). Because PHP does not have such user-defined literals, there are no technical problems with using the underscore as a digit separator. This proposal therefore seeks to follow suite with the other languages.

==== Why no support for stringy numerics? ====
This RFC does not include stringy numerics because of the BC breakage involved. It would cause the coercion rules for strings to integers to change, which may potentially have wide-ranging impacts for PHP programs. If formatting stringy integer literals is desired, then support for these can be done in the next major version of PHP.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There are no BC breaks with this feature.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
PHP 7.1

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No impact.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No impact.

==== To Opcache ====
No impact.

==== New Constants ====
No impact.

==== php.ini Defaults ====
No impact.

===== Open Issues =====
None so far.

===== Future Scope =====
Support for stringy numerics could be added in the next major version.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
A simple yes/no voting option with a 2/3 majority required.

===== Patches and Tests =====
A patch has been made - this part will be updated soon.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
