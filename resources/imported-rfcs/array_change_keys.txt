===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes a new core function to simplify the process of changing an array's keys ("re-keying").

===== The Problem =====

PHP only has one existing function to change an array's keys: ''array_change_key_case()''.  Unfortunately this can only transform keys to upper- or lower-case.

Because this function doesn't allow developers to specify their own custom logic to transform keys to something else, one must typically resort to using a ''foreach'' loop to build a new array:

<code php>
<?php
$newArray = [];
foreach ($oldArray as $key => $value) {
    $newKey = 'someValue'; // Whatever custom logic is needed
    $newArray[$newKey] = $value;
}
</code>

This approach requires no less than 4 lines of code.  Furthermore, this logic cannot be wrapped as a parameter to some other function.

That latter issue can solved by composing several existing functions like so:

<code php>
<?php
$newArray = array_combine(
    array_map(function ($value) {
        return 'someValue'; // Whatever custom logic is needed
    }, array_values($oldArray)),
    array_values($oldArray)
);
</code>

While this does work, it has some major drawbacks:

  * Requires no less than 4 function calls, each of which returns a new array.
  * The anonymous function only has access to the original key **or** the original value - **not both**.
  * The purpose of the code is not immediately obvious.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes the creation of a new core function ''array_change_keys()'':

<code php>
array array_change_keys(array $originalArray, callable $callback)
</code>

This function takes two arguments:

  - An ''array'' to re-key.
  - A ''callable'' which returns a new key for each array element.

The new ''array'' returned by this function will contain the same values in the same order, but with potentially different keys.

This parameter order is consistent with all other array functions (except for ''array_map()'', which is a special case due to its variadic nature.)

==== Callable ====

Two parameters will be passed to the ''callable'' for each element in the array:

  - The element's original key (''string'' or ''int'')
  - The element's original value (''mixed'')

The callable must return a ''string'' or ''int'' to be used as the new key.

=== Returning Invalid Types ===

Returning any type besides ''string'' or ''int'' will result in the following warning:

<code>
Warning: array_change_keys(): New key should be either a string or an integer
</code>

Additionally, the current array item will not be added to the resulting array.  PHP will still attempt to process all subsequent elements.

This matches the behavior of calling ''array_flip'' on an array containing types other than ''string'' or ''int''.

=== Returning Duplicate Keys ===

If the callable returns the same key for multiple values, the last one "wins".  For example:

<code php>
<?php
var_dump(array_change_keys([1, 2, 3], function(){ return 'foo'; }));

// array(1) {
//   ["foo"]=>
//   int(3)
// }
</code>

==== Function Name ====

PHP already has an ''array_change_key_case()'' function, so sharing a common root name (''array_change_key'') seems like a logic choice.

Other function which deal with multiple keys (like ''array_keys'' and ''array_fill_keys'') are pluralized, so we're using that same convention here.

===== Discussion =====

This section will be updated with any additional pros/cons that arise during the discussion period.

==== Pros ====

=== Faster Execution ===

Re-keying an array with ''array_change_keys()'' is faster than the two alternate approaches shown earlier:

{{:rfc:array_change_keys_benchmark.png?800|}}

=== Cleaner Code ===

Using this function makes it immediately obvious to other developers that an array is being re-keyed.

==== Cons ====

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 7.x release

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
This RFC should not impact the SAPI's.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No existing extensions are affected.

==== To Opcache ====
Unknown

===== Open Issues =====
None

===== Future Scope =====

Returning ''__toString()''able objects from the callback is not supported by this RFC.  This matches the behavior of other functions like ''array_flip()'' and ''array_fill_keys()''.  If such functionality is desired, a separate RFC could be created to add this functionality to all similar functions.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Because this is not a language change, a 50%+1 vote will be required to add this new function.

===== Patches and Tests =====
A proposed implementation is provided with this RFC: [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1925]]

Several tests are also included.
