====== PHP RFC: Your Title Here ======
  * Version: 0.1

  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====
This RFC proposes a new core function to simplify the process of changing an array's keys ("re-keying").

==== The Problem ====

PHP only has one existing function to change an array's keys: ''array_change_key_case()''.  Unfortunately this can only transform keys to upper- or lower-case.

Because this function doesn't allow developers to specify their own custom logic to transform keys to something else, one must typically resort to using a ''foreach'' loop to build a new array:

<code php>
<?php
$newArray = [];
foreach ($oldArray as $key => $value) {
    $newKey = ''; // Perform some transformation here
    $newArray[$newKey] = $value;
}
</code>

This approach requires no less than 4 lines of code.  Furthermore, this logic cannot be wrapped as a parameter to some other function.

That latter issue can solved by composing several existing functions like so:

<code php>
<?php
$newArray = array_combine(
    array_map(function ($value) {
        return 'foo'; // Perform some transformation here
    }, array_values($oldArray)),
    array_values($oldArray)
);
</code>

While this does work, it has some major drawbacks:

  * Requires no less than 4 function calls, each of which returns a new array.
  * The anonymous function only has access to the original key **or** the original value - **not both**.
  * The purpose of the code is not immediately obvious.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes the creation of a new core function ''array_change_keys()'':

<code php>
array array_change_keys(array $originalArray, callable $callback)
</code>

This function takes two arguments:

  - An ''array'' to re-key.
  - A ''callable'' which returns a new key for each array element.

(The order of these arguments will be a secondary voting option).

The new ''array'' returned by this function will contain the same values in the same order, but with potentially different keys.

==== Callable ====

Two parameters will be passed to the ''callable'' for each element in the array:

  - The element's original key (''string'' or ''int'')
  - The element's original value (''mixed'')

The callable must return a ''string'' or ''int'' to be used as the new key.

=== Returning Invalid Types ===

Returning any type besides ''string'' or ''int'' will result in the following warning:

<code>
Warning: array_change_keys(): New key should be either a string or an integer
</code>

Additionally, the current array item will not be added to the resulting array.  PHP will still attempt to process all subsequent elements.

This matches the behavior of calling ''array_flip'' on an array containing types other than ''string'' or ''int''.

=== Returning Duplicate Keys ===

If the callable returns the same key for multiple values, the last one "wins".  For example:

<code php>
<?php
var_dump(array_change_keys([1, 2, 3], function(){ return 'foo'; }));

// array(1) {
//   ["foo"]=>
//   int(3)
// }
</code>

==== Function Name ====

PHP already has an ''array_change_key_case()'' function, so sharing a common root name (''array_change_key'') seems like a logic choice.

Other function which deal with multiple keys (like ''array_keys'' and ''array_fill_keys'') are pluralized, so we're using that same convention here.

===== Discussion =====

This section will be updated with any additional pros/cons that arise during the discussion period.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 7.x release

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
This RFC should not impact the SAPI's.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No existing extensions are affected.

==== To Opcache ====
**TODO: UNKNOWN**

===== Open Issues =====
Make sure there are no open issues when the vote starts!

===== Future Scope =====

Returning ''__toString()''able objects from the callback is not supported by this RFC.  This matches the behavior of other functions like ''array_flip()'' and ''array_fill_keys()''.  If such functionality is desired, a separate RFC could be created to add this functionality to all similar functions.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This RFC requires a 2/3 majority (see [[voting]]).

A second voting option (requiring a 50%+1 majority) will be provided for determining the order of parameters for this new function.  There will be two choices:

1. array, callable
2. callable, array

===== Patches and Tests =====
A proposed implementation is provided with this RFC.  While it seems to work well, a closer review by an experienced core developer would be greatly appreciated.

**TODO LINK TO THE FINAL PATCH HERE**

Several tests are also included.
