===== Introduction =====

Coming to Object-Orientated Programming, PHP offers a variety of possibilities to obtain information about classes and their instances (objects). In this regard, the classes/objects functions (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.classobj.php) as well as the reflection API (http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php) do a great job. But still there is no function to obtain a particular information: the number of instances of a class. 

One might say, simply implement a static counter in each class. But what about built-in classes like SPL? A wrapper would be required. Implementing it this way, it does not only sound, but it actually is cumbersome. The purpose of this RFC is to address this issue.

===== Proposal =====

The proposal is to add a new function returning an array ('name of the class' => number of instances) in the current script.

The function name should fit in with the current names of class/object functions. Therefore, the name **get_instances_counts()** seems to be reasonable, but is still up for discussion.

Example #1:
<code php>
print_r (get_instances_counts());
// Array ()

$foo = new StdClass;

print_r (get_instances_counts());
// Array ( [StdClass] => 1 )

$bar = new StdClass;

print_r (get_instances_counts());
// Array ( [StdClass] => 2 )
</code>

===== A candidate for reflection API? =====

Furthermore, it need to be clarified, if the number of instances of a class is an information allowing you to reflect on a class or not?

  * Answering with no, you should agree with this proposal not belonging to the reflection API.

  * Answering with yes, things are getting a bit more complicated. There are different imaginable scenarios:

==== Reflection API only (Reflection) ====

//Instead of// get_instances_counts(), there would be a public static function in **Reflection**. 

The example #1 changes as follows (note the CamelCase instead of underscores):
<code php>
print_r (Reflection::getInstancesCounts());
// Array ()

$foo = new StdClass;

print_r (Reflection::getInstancesCounts());
// Array ( [StdClass] => 1 )

$bar = new StdClass;

print_r (Reflection::getInstancesCounts());
// Array ( [StdClass] => 2 )
</code>

==== Reflection API (ReflectionClass) + class/object function ====

The code in example #1 stays unchanged. In addition, ReflectionClass provides a method to get the counter of a particular class:

<code php>
$reflection = new ReflectionClass('StdClass');
print $reflection->getInstanceCounter();
// 0

$foo = new StdClass;

print $reflection->getInstanceCounter();
// 1

$bar = new StdClass;

print $reflection->getInstanceCounter();
// 2
</code>
