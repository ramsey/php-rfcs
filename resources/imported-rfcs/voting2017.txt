====== PHP RFC: Voting ======
  * Version: 2.0.0001
  * Date: 2017
  * Author: Zeev Suraski <zeev@php.net>
  * Status: Draft (or Under Discussion or Accepted or Declined)
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting2017


===== Introduction =====
This RFC amends and replaces https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting with the main goals of being clearer, more concise, and eliminating ambiguities as much as possible.

Specifically, this RFC does that via:
  * Clarifying and redefining voting thresholds
  * Clarifying and redefining voting workflows
  * Clarifying and redefining voting eligibility


===== Background =====

Since the [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting|original Voting RFC]] was published back in 2011, it gradually became clear that the language in it is ambiguous, and in some cases - shortsighted.
To name some examples:
  * The definition of 'who gets a vote' was very fluid
  * The definition of which votes require a 2/3 majority and which ones don't was very fluid
  * The voting workflow text was very terse - and left elements such as 'canceled votes' unhandled and open for interpretation
  * Even the definition of what requires a vote in the first place was not clear

Because of its many shortcomings, this RFC does not attempt to 'fix' the original Voting RFC, but rather rewrite it - factoring in the lessons learned in the last 6+ years.

===== Proposal =====

==== Definitions ====
  * **Changes to PHP:**  Functionality that is added, changed, deprecated or removed from the PHP language, including any bundled extensions.

  * **PHP Packaging Decisions:**  Decisions that deal with support timelines, release timelines or version numbering, but that do not otherwise impact the functionality of PHP or any of its bundled extensions.

  * **RFC**: Request For Comments for a proposed Change to PHP or for a PHP Packaging Decision, published on http://wiki.php.net/rfc/.

  * **Implementation Decisions:**  Decision regarding the technical implementation of PHP or any of its bundled extension, that do not have any impact on end users (with the exception of performance improvement or degradation).

  * **Release Manager(s)**

  * **PHP**:  The PHP package in source code or binary form, that are available on the main downloads page at http://www.php.net

For changes affecting the core language, you should also provide a patch for the language specification.
