====== PHP RFC: JSON numeric as string ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2015-04-09
  * Author: Jakub Zelenka, bukka@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/json_numeric_as_string

===== Introduction =====
JSON is a data format that is often used for data exchange between different platforms. These platforms can have different number representation which might lead to problems like type inconsistency or worse in loosing information (e.g. issue with double precision)

===== Proposal =====
The proposal is to introduce new options for dealing with this problem by converting the data to string.

==== Float to string conversion ====
The first option called ''JSON_FLOAT_AS_STRING'' will convert all float values to string.

=== Decoding ===
The idea is to convert all float values to string during decoding. That will prevent loosing precision.

== Example ==
<code php>
$data = json_decode('[1.23343224234, 1.34]', true, 512, JSON_FLOAT_AS_STRING);
var_dump($data);
</code>

will output:
<code>
array(2) {
  [0] =>
  string(13) "1.23343224234"
  [1] =>
  string(4) "1.34"
}
</code>

=== Encoding ===
The idea is to convert all float values to string during encoding.

== Example ==
<code php>
ini_set('precision', 12);
echo json_encode(array( "a"=>1.23343224234), JSON_FLOAT_AS_STRING);
</code>

will output

<code>
{"a":"1.23343224234"}
</code>


==== Integer to string conversion ====
The second option called ''JSON_INT_AS_STRING'' will convert all int values to string.

=== Decoding ===
The idea is to convert all int values to string during decoding. That will prevent loosing precision.

== Example ==
<code php>
$data = json_decode('[23343224234, 34]', true, 512, JSON_INT_AS_STRING);
var_dump($data);
</code>

will output:
<code>
array(2) {
  [0] =>
  string(11) "23343224234"
  [1] =>
  string(2) "34"
}
</code>

===== Currently =====

<code php>
var_dump(json_decode('{"test":1234567890.12345678}',true));
</code>

Data has lost precision. One way to mitigate this is by doing some string manipulation, else would be to make the json field test a string but would be sometimes out of the developers control.

<code>
array(1) {
  ["test"]=>
  float(1234567890.1235)
}
</code>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
The code that defines ''JSON_FLOAT_AS_STRING'' and/or ''JSON_INT_AS_STRING'' will be broken. However the constants have ''JSON_'' prefix so their usage is not recommended and it should be relatively safe addition.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
The proposed versions will be one of the voting options as some might consider it as not a self-contained feature.

There will be choice of 3 PHP version. The reason for that is that some might not consider the feature as self-contained addition.
  - 5.6.next : this option will consider the feature/bug as a self-contained small addition. The precedence for this is adding ''JSON_PRESERVE_ZERO_FRACTION''.
  - 7.0: this option will consider the feature/bug as a self-contained and but does not consider feature important for 5.6
  - 7.1: this option will consider the feature/bug as a non self-contained addition

===== New Constants =====
=== JSON_FLOAT_AS_STRING ===
  * json_decode - all float values will be decoded as string
    * It's often an issue for very large float values with many fractional digits that are coming from platforms that support larger float representation than double. In that case the conversion is lost and there is no way how to get it back. Converting the value to string keep the precision and resolves the problem.
  * json_encode - all float values will be encoded as string
    * Re-using the constant for encoder makes sense if PHP creates JSON for platform that support lower float type (e.g. C float) and the precision loss is not acceptable

=== JSON_INT_AS_STRING ===
  * json_decode - all int values will be decoded as string
    * When decoding numbers that that are on the edge of max integer, the JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING can produce int type for some number and string types for others. This can be often inconvenient if the type consistency is required (e.g. further serialization/encoding for other platforms) 
  * json_encode - all int values will be encoded as string
    * Re-using the constant for encoder makes sense if PHP creates JSON for platform that support lower int type (e.g. from 64bit to 32bit platform) and decoder on remote platform can't handle bigger integers

===== Open Issues =====
Better names?

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
This RFC is related only to JSON extension.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
There will be 5 voting:
  - whether include ''JSON_FLOAT_TO_STRING'' for decoding
  - whether include ''JSON_FLOAT_TO_STRING'' for encoding
  - whether include ''JSON_INT_TO_STRING'' for decoding
  - whether include ''JSON_INT_TO_STRING'' for encoding
  - choice of the version (see above)

50%+1 majority (see [[voting]]) for all votings


===== Patches and Tests =====
The patch is really simple and will be implemented by the author of this RFC if it's accepted.
