====== PHP RFC: Remove PHP 4 Constructors ======
  * Version: 1.0

===== Introduction =====
PHP 4 constructors are methods that have the same name as the class they are defined in. PHP 5 preserved the ability to use PHP 4 style constructors in some cases. The strangeness of when the constructor is and isn't used increases the mental model for programmers.

<PHP>
class Filter {

    // A constructor in PHP 4 and 5
    function filter($a) {}
}
</PHP>

<PHP>
// Namespaced classes do not recognize PHP 4 constructors
namespace NS;
class Filter {

    // Not a constructor
    function filter($a) {}
}
</PHP>

<PHP>
// Defining __construct before filter makes filter a normal method
class Filter {
    function __construct() {}

    // Not a constructor
    function filter($a) {}
}

//… but the other way raises an E_STRICT

class Filter {

    // A constructor…
    function filter($a) {}

    //…until this overrides it and raises E_STRICT
    function __construct() {}
}
</PHP>


===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposes that in PHP 7 methods with the same name as the class they are defined will not be recognized as constructors in any context. This simplifies the rules for constructors which helps programmers and php-src maintainers.

Under this proposal, <php>function filter</php> would no longer be recognized as a constructor:

<PHP>
class Filter {

    // A constructor in PHP 4 and 5; not in PHP 7
    function filter($a) {}
}
</PHP>

This RFC proposes that in PHP 5.7 a ''E_DEPRECATED'' notice would be raised whenever a PHP 4 style constructor is used. This would help migration from PHP 5 to PHP 7. Note that the RFC to [[/rfc/switch.default.multiple#proposal|remove multiple default statements from switch blocks]] proposed this same technique.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
This will break code that relies on PHP 4 constructors. The solution is to rename the constructors to `__construct`. This will allow the class to be compatible with PHP 5, but breaks compatibility with PHP 4 completely.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
This RFC targets PHP 7 and PHP 5.NEXT.

===== RFC Impact =====
This RFC has no impact to SAPI's or extensions.

==== To Opcache ====
Opcache is likely to be unaffected by this proposal, but this has not yet been verified.

===== Open Issues =====
There are some tests that rely on behavior that this RFC would remove to trigger error conditions((See [[https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/tests/errmsg_045.phpt|Zend/tests/errmsg_045.phpt]])). These tests would need to find a different error trigger.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
This RFC requires 2/3 vote in favor of removing PHP 4 style constructors to pass.
