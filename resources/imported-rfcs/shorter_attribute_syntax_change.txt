  * Version: 2.0

===== Introduction =====

Based on the expressions of concern over using ''@@'' for Shorter Attribute Syntax RFC https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax, I propose to use ''#[]'' instead. Please keep in mind that we want the **best** syntax, and not necessarily the best **looking** syntax.

The ''@@'' has several issues, that other syntaxes don't have, a Matrix:
^ Syntax                             ^ @@Attr ^ #[Attr] ^ @[Attr] ^ <<Attr>> ^
| Number of required Characters      | 2      | 3       | 3       | 4        |
| Has End Delimiter                  | No     | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      |
| Allows Grouping                    | No     | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      |
| Forward Compatibilty in PHP 7      | No     | Yes     | No      | No       |
| Breaks BC of valid PHP 7 code      | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | No       |
| Used by other language             | No     | Yes     | No      | Yes      |
| Familiar with Docblock Usage       | Yes    | No      | No      | No       |
| Difficulties with Userland Parsers | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | No       |
| Target                             | 8.0    | 8.0     | 8.0     | 8.0      |
