===== Introduction =====

With the addition of scalar types in PHP 7, nullables in 7.1, `object` in 7.2, and lastly, union types in 8.0, people writing PHP code can explicitly declare type information for most function parameters, function returns, as well as class properties.

However, PHP has not always supported types, and most probably it will always allow to omit type information. But this leads to the problem that its meaning is ambiguous when type information is missing:

* the type is a specific type, but the programmer forgot to declare it.
* the type is a specific type, but the programmer omitted it to keep compatibility with an older PHP version
* the type is not currently expressible in PHP's type system, and so no type could be specified.
* for return types, it is not clear if the function will or will not return a value, other than null.

An explicit ''mixed'' type would allow people to add types to parameters, class properties and function returns to indicate that the type information wasn't forgotten about, it just can't be specified more precisely, or the programmer explicitly decided not to do so.

Currently, ''mixed'' can only be used in PHPDoc-based type hints to give more context about a type, but this is a suboptimal solution, since it also has the same problems that comments generally have.

One prominent example where the ''mixed'' type is extensively used in PHPDoc is the [stubs of PHP's own standard library](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/dfd0acf0d722fbbebeab349b0d4366dd8f30bbee/ext/standard/basic_functions.stub.php#L94) with which type information is defined for internal functions. If we had the native ''mixed'' type, we could provide more precise reflection information for users about functions that accept or return any type.

Additionally, the ''mixed'' pseudo-type is used widely in the PHP manual:

<code php>
var_dump ( mixed $expression [, mixed $... ] ) : void
</code>


===== Proposal =====


This RFC proposes to add the mixed type to be used in PHP's type system. A type of ''mixed'' would be equivalent to ''array|bool|callable|int|float|null|object|resource|string'' as this is the correct behaviour to conform to LSP using PHP's implementation of type checking for inheritance.

==== LSP, Covariance and Contravariance ====

The proposal conforms to the [Liskov Substituion Priniciple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle), when performing signature checks for inheritance.

Since 7.4 PHP allows [covariant returns and contravariant parameters](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/covariant-returns-and-contravariant-parameters).

PHP allows contravariance (aka type widening) for parameter types to obey the LSP principle. A subclass may use a 'wider' aka less specific type in place of the inherited type for a parameter.

PHP allows covariance (aka type narrowing) for return types to obey the LSP principle. A subclass may use a 'narrower' aka more specific type in place of the inherited type for a function return.

==== Parameter types are contravariant ====

A parameter type may be widened in a subclass from a specific value type to the ''mixed'' type as this is contravariant and so is allowed in LSP.

<code php>
// Valid example

class A
{
    public function foo(int $value) {}
}

class B extends A
{
    // Parameter type was widened from int to mixed, this is allowed
    public function foo(mixed $value) {}
}
</code>

A parameter type may not be narrowed in a subclass to a more specific type as this is not contravariant and so violates LSP.

<code php>
// Invalid example

class A
{
    public function foo(mixed $value) {}
}

class B extends A
{
    // Parameter type cannot be narrowed from mixed to int
    // Fatal error thrown
    public function foo(int $value) {}
}
</code>

====  Return types are covariant ====

The ''mixed'' return type could be narrowed in a subclass as this is covariant and is allowed in LSP.

<code php>
// Valid example

class A
{
    public function bar(): mixed {}
}

class B extends A
{
    // return type was narrowed from mixed to int, this is allowed
    public function bar(): int {}
}
</code>

Specific return type may not be widened by using ''mixed'' as this is not covariant and so breaks LSP.

<code php>
// Invalid example

class C
{
    public function bar(): int {}
}

class D extends C
{
    // return type cannot be widened from int to mixed
    // Fatal error thrown
    public function bar(): mixed {}
}
</code>

==== Property types are invariant ====

Following the [typed properties RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/typed_properties_v2#inheritance_and_variance), all property types are invariant.

<code php>
// Invalid example

class A
{
    public mixed $foo;
    public int $bar;
    public $baz;
}

class B extends A
{
    // property type cannot be narrowed from mixed to int
    // Fatal error thrown
    public int $foo;
}

class C extends A
{
    // property type cannot be widened from int to mixed
    // Fatal error thrown
    public mixed $bar;
}

class D extends A
{
    // property type cannot be added
    // Fatal error thrown
    public mixed $baz;
}

class E extends A
{
    // property type cannot be removed
    // Fatal error thrown
    public $foo;
}
</code>

==== Void return type ====

The signature checking done in PHP for functions that return void does not currently allow covariance, even though that could be conformant to LSP.

<code php>
class A
{
    public function bar(): void {}
}

class B extends A
{
    public function bar(): int {}
}

// Fatal error: Declaration of B::bar(): int must be compatible with A::bar(): void
</code>

The position of this RFC is to follow the existing behaviour: i.e. you can't widen the type from ''void'' to ''mixed'', when inheriting.

====  Signature checking of function when no parameter type present ====

When no type is present for a function parameter, the signature checks for inheritance are done as if the parameter had a ''mixed'' type.

<code php>
class A
{
    // no type is specified, mixed type is assumed
    public function foo($value) {}
}

class B extends A
{
    // mixed type is explicitly specified, and is invariant to
    // type in parent class
    public function foo(mixed $value) {}
}

class C extends B
{
    // no type is specified, mixed type is assumed which is
    // invariant to type in parent class
    public function foo($value) {}
}

class D extends B
{
    public function foo(mixed $value = null) {}
}
</code>

Currently this only affects inheritance in classes.

If/when PHP gains the abilties to declare [function signatures as types](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/typedef_callables.md), rather than just the generic ''callable'' type this signature checking should work for those signature checks also.

==== Signature checking of function when no return type present ====

When no type is present for a function return, the signature checks for inheritance are done as if the parameter had a ''mixed|void'' type.

 When no type is specified, the same method in a subclass must either also declare no return type, declare ''void'' or declare ''mixed'' (or any other value type which is subtype of ''mixed''). Additionally neither ''mixed'' nor ''void'' return types could be changed back to no type since this would widen the resulting type.

<code php>
class A
{
    // no return type is specified, mixed|void is assumed
    public function foo() {}
}

class B extends A
{
    // mixed type is explicitly specified. The type 'mixed' is
    // covariant to 'mixed|void' and so is allowed to be declared
    // for this function.
    public function foo(): mixed {}
}

class C extends B
{
    // INVALID - no type is specified, mixed|void is assumed.
    // 'mixed|void' is not covariant to 'mixed' and so this breaks LSP.
    // Fatal error is thrown
    public function foo() {}
}

class D extends B
{
    // INVALID - as void is not subtype of mixed, Fatal error is thrown
    public function foo(): void {}
}
</code>

==== The mixed|void union type ====

The position of this RFC is that supporting a union of ''mixed|void'' is not needed and so proposes not allowing that type declaration to be used. This limitation could be lifted at a later date if a use-case was found.

==== Nullability ====

The ''mixed'' is a union type that accepts any value type, including ''null''. Allowing the ''mixed'' type declaration to be nullable would be duplication of information i.e. ''?mixed'' would be always be equivalent to be ''mixed''.

The position of this RFC is to not support nullability of ''mixed'' type. This could always be added at a later date if a requirement for adding it was discovered. This would be part of a separate RFC that would address directly which 'redundant types' should or shouldn't be allowed.

<code php>
//INVALID - Fatal error: Mixed types cannot be nullable, null is already part of the mixed type.
function foo(?mixed $arg) {}

//INVALID - Fatal error: Mixed types cannot be nullable, null is already part of the mixed type.
function bar(): ?mixed {}
</code>

==== Resource 'type' ====

Although variables can be a ''resource'' in PHP, it is not possible to use ''resource'' as a parameter, return or property type in userland PHP code.

The position of this RFC is that ''resource'' variables of type ''resource'' should pass the ''mixed'' type check as that is the most useful thing to do.

====  Mixed vs any ====

This RFC proposes ''mixed'' rather than ''any'' since ''mixed'' has been used widely in the PHP ecosystem already (e.g. the PHP manual, static analysis tools like PHPStan and Psalm, IDEs).

Also, choosing to use ''any'' would likely have a slightly bigger BC break, as ''mixed'' is a [soft reserved](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/reserve_even_more_types_in_php_7) keyword since PHP 7, but ''any'' hasn't had any warnings against using it as a class name.
