====== PHP RFC: Object typehint ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-08-12
  * Author: Michał Brzuchalski <michal.brzuchalski@gmail.com>
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/object-typehint
  
Following the raging success of PHP 7.0 additions [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5|scalar type hints]] and [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types|return types]],
there is also place for object typehint and return type. That feature can replace double ''is_object()'' validation inside function/method and it's result validation - which increases performance at runtime about ~6%.

===== Introduction =====
Function and method typehints allow to declare expected sort of scalar type or class/interface but there is no way to declare any object type.
Function and method return type allow to declare expected sort of scalar type or class/interface but there is same situation imposiible to declare any object type.
Those two (typehint and return type) should exists both for consistency, allowing typehint should able to declare same return type.

===== Proposal =====
The ''object'' typehint and return type should be added to the engine, working the same way like in case of scalar does.
This would also mean to make ''object'' a reserved classname.

==== Return type ====

=== Function ===
Function return-type set to ''object'' acts exactly as it is for scalar return-type right now. It means there is return-type validation at runtime based on ''zval'' type.

<code php>
function shouldReturnObject() : object {
    $obj = json_decode('{}');
    return $obj;
}
</code>

=== Methods ===
Method return-type set to ''object'' behaves the same as for function return-type in both class/interface contexts.

<code php>
class One {
    public function a() : object {}
}
interface Two {
    public function a() : object;
}
</code>

There is possibility to add return-type at inheritance in both class/interface contexts.

<code php>
class One {
    public function a() {}
}
class SubOne extends One {
    public function a() : object {}
}
interface Two {
    public function a();
}
interface SubTwo extends Two {
    public function a() : object;
}
</code>

At inheritance there must be same declaration type so it works like for scalar/class return-type. Missing return type at inheritance returns ''Fatal error: Declaration of Inherited::a() must be compatible with Original::a(): object''.

==== Parameter type hint ====

=== Function ===
Function parameter type-hint set to ''object'' acts exactly as it is for scalar type-hint right now. It means there is validation of given params type at runtime.

<code php>
function acceptsObject(object $obj) {
    // there is no need to check `is_object($obj)` yo can simply check for eg. `instanceof`
    if ($obj instanceOf \stdClass) {
    
    } elseif ($obj instanceof \MyObject) {
    
    }
}
acceptsObject(json_decode('{}'));
acceptsObject(new \MyObject());
</code>

=== Methods ===
Method type-hint set to ''object'' behaves the same as for function type-hint in both class/interface contexts.

<code php>
class One {
    public function a(object $obj) {}
}
interface Two {
    public function a(object $obj);
}
</code>

At inheritance there must be same declaration type so it works like for scalar/class return-type. Missing type-hint at inheritance returns eg. ''Warning: Declaration of Two::a(object $obj) should be compatible with One::a($obj)''.

====== Benefits ======
The main reason ''object'' type should be added is filling a gap caused of no root-class in PHP type system.

  - ''object'' type declarations allow functions to require that parameters are objects at call time.
  - ''object'' type declarations doesn't need additional ''is_object()'' validation in functions
  - ''object'' type declarations keeps compatibility at intheritance
  - ''object'' return type allow functions to validate that return value is object at call time
  - ''object'' return type keeps compatibility at inheritance
  - ''object'' return type and type declarations both eliminates double ''is_object()'' validation given param and returned value which increases performance at runtime about ~6% faster

If the given/returned value is of the incorrect type, then PHP will throw a TypeError exception.
If methods declaration differs at inheritance there is warning generated.

====== Reflection ======
There are two changes in reflection:
  - ''ReflectionType::isBuiltin'' returns true if ''object'' type-hint or return-type used in case of objects given, it returns false when class used instead of ''object'' type hint as it was before
  - ''ReflectionType::__toString'' returns ''"object"'' when type-hint or return-type used in case of objects given, it returns class name when class used instead of ''object'' keyword as it was before

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
Althought ''object'' is [[http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.other-reserved-words.php|soft reserved word]] this RFC adds ''object'' as reserved classname. This may collide with existing classes which are neither namespaced nor prefixed.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
This is proposed for the next minor version of PHP, currently PHP 7.2.

===== RFC Impact =====

==== To SAPIs ====
None.

==== To Existing Extensions ====
None.

==== Unaffected PHP Functionality ====

This doesn't affect the behaviour of cast operators.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required. The vote is a straight Yes/No vote for accepting the RFC and merging the patch.
