====== PHP RFC: Making stdClass iterable ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2019-01-12
  * Author: Craig Duncan <php@duncanc.co.uk>
  * Proposed version: PHP 7.4
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

By far the most common usage of ''stdClass'' is (as the [[http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.classes.php|manual]] defines) "Created by typecasting to object", or from the result of a call to 'json_decode()' using the default parameters.
In both of these scenarios the resulting object is analogous to a plain array. Although it is a class, it has no methods or private/protected properties, it is simply an array that uses a different syntax for accessing its elements.

However the ''iterable'' type (introduced in PHP 7.1) does not accept this object, despite accepting the virtually identical array it was born from.

===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes that ''stdClass'' is changed to implement the ''Traversable'' interface so that code using the ''iterable'' type can accept/return these objects.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

This RFC aims to be fully backward compatible, although the implementation of the iteration will likely change, all existing behaviour of iterating over ''stdClass'' will be retained.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

PHP 7.4

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

Simple Yes/No vote that doesn't change the language itself so requires 50% + 1 votes to get 'accepted'. 

===== Implementation =====

An initial proof of concept is available here:

(note that this implementation is not complete, it still has some edge cases and may change significantly)
