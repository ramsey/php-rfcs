===== Introduction =====

Currently, PHP has no way to provide type hinting for function parameters which are not classes or arrays. This is on often requested feature that has been discussed on the internals list many many times. This RFC discusses a new implementation of this feature that attempts to stay close to php's type shifting roots, and attempts to mirror //zend_parse_parameters// as much as possible.

==== Philosophy ====

This RFC discusses a method of adding scalar type hints to PHP while attempting to embrace the dynamic nature of PHP variables.  This means that passing a type that does not exactly match the hinted type will cause a cast to happen. This cast will only succeed if the argument can be cleanly converted to the requested type. If it cannot be converted without significant data-loss, an //E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR// will be raised.

For consistency, this patch attempts to largely follow //zend_parse_parameters()// for the validation rules, but disallows lossy conversion from float to int (1.5 -> int generates an error) and non-well-formed numeric values for float or int ('123abc' is an error).

===== Proposal =====

==== Engine Changes ====

The current implementation introduces four new reserved words: //int//, //float//, //bool// and //string//. These were not previously reserved, because casting is a special case in the lexer.

If this causes a problem, it would be possible to revert to the previous implementation, where the parser still detects the type hints as object type hints and the compiler (zend_compile.c) then detects the exact value for the type hint, changing the stored hint from IS_OBJECT to the proper type (freeing the string).

==== Syntax ====

Four new type hints are introduced with this patch:

  * //int// - Matching integers only
  * //float// - Matching floating point numbers
  * //bool// - Matching boolean parameters only
  * //string// - Matching strings only

==== Conversion Rules ====

Conversion is allowed only if data-loss does not happen. There are a few exceptions (objects using <nowiki>__toString</nowiki>, strings containing leading numerics, etc). Here's a table of examples. 

  * //fail// indicates an E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR
  * //pass// indicates no error and a conversion
  * //notice// indicates an E_NOTICE and a conversion

^ value                   ^ string ^ float  ^ int    ^ boolean‡^ array ^
^ true (boolean)          | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ false (boolean)         | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ 0 (integer)             | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ 1 (integer)             | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ 12 (integer)            | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ 12 (double)             | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |

^ 'true' (string)         | pass   | fail   | fail   | pass    | fail  |
^ 'false' (string)        | pass   | fail   | fail   | pass    | fail  |
^ '0' (string)            | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ '1' (string)            | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ '12' (string)           | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ '12abc' (string)        | pass   | fail   | fail   | pass    | fail  |
^ '12.0' (string)         | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ '12.34' (string)        | pass   | pass   | fail   | pass    | fail  |
^ 'foo' (string)          | pass   | fail   | fail   | pass    | fail  |
^ array () (array)        | fail   | fail   | fail   | fail    | pass  |
^ array (0 => 12) (array) | fail   | fail   | fail   | fail    | pass  |
^ NULL (NULL)             | pass   | pass   | pass   | pass    | fail  |
^ %%''%% (string)         | pass   | fail   | fail   | pass    | fail  |
^ 1 (resource)            | fail   | fail   | fail   | fail    | fail  |
^ StdClass                | fail   | fail*  | fail*  | fail†   | fail  |
^ implementing __toString | pass   | fail*  | fail*  | fail†   | fail  |

<nowiki>*</nowiki>actually //notice// in patch as it stands due to behaviour of default object casting handler

†actually //pass// in patch as it stands due to behaviour of default object casting handler

‡likely subject to change, see Booleans section below

It's important to note that passing `12.5` as a float or string to a //int// type hint will presently fail, since data-loss would occur (this diverges from //zend_parse_parameters// which would truncate the value).

==== Errors ====

If a provided hint does not match at all ("foo" passed to an //int// hint), an //E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR// is raised. This includes non-well-formed numerics passed to an //int// or //float// hinted parameter, unlike zend_parse_parameters which would simply raise an //E_NOTICE//.

==== Defaults ====

Any value can be entered as a default. Presently even array() is allowable for an int type hint. The default is converted at run-time when it is accessed.

This can lead to odd bugs, so in the future it would be good to validate the default in zend_compile.c (casting it where appropriate, checking for a valid cast).

==== References ====

The current implementation treats references like any other value. If it casts, the referenced value is casted. 

==== New APIs ====

This current proposal adds a series of conversion functions to the core:

  * //int convert_to_{type}_safe(zval <nowiki>**</nowiki>ptr)// - Convert the zval to {type}. Return value indicates if conversion was "clean". (FAILURE indicates unclean conversion)
  * //int convert_to_{type}_safe_ex(zval <nowiki>**</nowiki>ptr)// - Separate zval if not a reference, and convert to {type}. Return indicates clean conversion (FAILURE indicates unclean conversion).

These functions pairs exist for //long//, //double//, //string// and //boolean//.

==== New Methods ====

For consistency, the following new methods have been added to //ReflectionParameter//

  * //isInt()// - boolean to determine if parameter is type-hinted as an integer.
  * //isFloat()// - boolean to determine if parameter is type-hinted as a float.
  * //isBool()// - boolean to determine if parameter is type-hinted as a boolean.
  * //isString()// - boolean to determine if parameter is type-hinted as a string.

==== Patch ====

The modifications necessary to implement this feature exist on the [[https://github.com/TazeTSchnitzel/php-src/tree/scalar_type_hints|scalar_type_hints branch of Andrea's GitHub fork]] (forked from the [[https://github.com/ircmaxell/php-src/tree/scalar_type_hints|branch on ircmaxell's GitHub fork]]). It is still a work-in-progress, and should be considered unstable at this time.

===== Possible Changes =====

==== Float to Int Casting Rules ====

At present, the cast from float to int results in an error if the int doesn't exactly represent the float (satisfying a double cast: //val = (double) (long) val//). And a cast from an int to a float follows the same semantics (as on 64 bit platforms PHP_INT_MAX is not exactly representable by a float).

This could be relaxed for semi-representable values. So 1.5 could be allowed for an int parameter (casted to 1). But //float(99999999999999999999)// would not, because it would lose a lot of information in the transfer (would be casted to PHP_INT_MAX).

I believe the current behavior (error on non-exactly-representable) is the correct one. However, this could be changed to an E_NOTICE instead indicating that partial data was lost.

==== Warning On Data Loss ====

We could also change the E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR on data-loss to an E_WARNING. That would allow data-loss to continue. The value passed in would still be cast according to the normal casting rules. So passing //"foo"// to an int parameter would result in //int(1)// and an E_WARNING.

==== Handling of StdClass and other objects ====

While an E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR result when passing a StdClass (and other objects with the default object handlers) to parameters hinted as int, float or bool would be desirable, the patch as it stands does not do this. Instead, for the int and float cases, an E_NOTICE is emitted and the result back is 1, and in the bool case, no error at all happens and the result back is true. To make this yield E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR would require detecting the default object handler (an ugly hack which also wouldn't make the behaviour sensible for non-defaults), or changing the behaviour and/or semantics of the object handler for casting, neither of which are particularly desirable. By keeping the current behaviour in the patch, we are consistent with casting and zend_parse_parameters. Furthermore, it could be argued that since objects are truthy, casting to bool without complaint here might not be a bad thing.

==== Booleans ====

Given that StdClass casts without error to bool in the patch as it stands, and there's no nice way of changing that (see previous section), should we just make all truthy values (including array(non-empty) and resource) cast to true without error, and all falsey values (including array() and empty string) cast to false without error?

While int, float and string only allow lossless casting (with the exception of objects), bool’s behaviour at the moment is quite different. The current behaviour leaves much to be desired, and there are some other options available.

One option is simply to forget about being lossless and make the bool type hint accept any value, meaning any truthy value or any falsey value would yield what is expected without error. This would ensure that if someone has passed in a non-boolean truthy/falsey value to your function, it’ll be handled correctly. It would mean all your bit hacks ($foo & FLAG etc.) would work and anything you got from $_GET (e.g. ?foobar=1). However, this is unlikely to catch bugs in code, because literally any PHP value would work. For that reason, this may not be the way forward.

Another option is go completely strict and allow only boolean values, failing everything else. This would be unlike the int, float and string hints, which are flexible and cast, but would be more helpful for catching bugs. However, not casting at all isn’t very “PHP-like”, and forcing people to manually cast with (bool) might not be ideal. If we were to go for this one, we could also accept objects casting to bool (which the default handler does), because otherwise we'd be stopping extension developers from making bool-like objects if they so pleased.

The final option this section considers is a limited set of values. TRUE, FALSE and NULL would be accepted, along with the integer and float values 1 and 0 (which are the int/float values TRUE and FALSE cast to, respectively), ‘1’ and the empty string (which are the string values TRUE and FALSE cast to), and ‘0’ (which (string)(int)FALSE would give you), along with objects casting to boolean. This is something of a compromise between the first two proposals.

Both the author of this RFC (Anthony) and the current maintainer (Andrea) are yet to settle on one specific option.
==== Handling of "123abc" for int and float ====

This has been changed to E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR, but should it perhaps be something softer, like E_NOTICE or E_WARNING?

With it as E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR, it can be considered to "fail" the typehint and hence the int and float typehints are lossless.
