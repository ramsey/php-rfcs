===== Introduction =====

PHP is a web-focussed programming language, so processing user data is a frequent activity. In such processing it is common to check for something's existence, and if it doesn't exist, use a default value. Yet the simplest way to do this, something along the lines of ''isset($_GET['mykey']) ? $_GET['mykey'] : ""'', is unnecessarily cumbersome. The short ternary operator, ''?:'' provides a way to do this much more conveniently: ''$_GET['mykey'] ? ""''. However, this is not good practise, as if the value does not exist it will raise an `E_NOTICE`. Because of these issues, some sort of ifsetor() operator or a modification to ''?:'''s behaviour to make this common pattern easier has been a frequent request (See References).

===== Proposal =====

The ''?:'' operator is overloaded, such that if the first operand is can be used with ''isset'', an implicit ''isset'' is performed alongside the truthiness check. This means the ''$_GET['mykey'] ?: ""'' shorthand is completely safe and will not raise an E_NOTICE.

Internally this is actually implemented by rewriting the expression within the compiler from ''$a ?: $b'' to ''empty($a) ? $b : $a''. This avoids introducing any new opcodes and allows us to leverage the existing infrastructure in place for ''empty''.

==== Backwards-compatibility considerations ====

Because ''empty'' is used, which performs a falsiness check, existing code using the ''?:'' operator should function the same. However, now no ''E_NOTICE'' will be raised if the variable does not exist. While this should not affect most applications, it might affect some applications using custom error handlers, so this is a minor backwards-compatibility break and targets a major version.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This proposed for the next PHP x, which at the time of this writing would be PHP 7.

===== Open Issues =====

None I'm aware of.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====

The behaviour of the long-form ternary operator, ''$a ? $b : $c'', ''isset'' and ''empty'' are unaffected. Where the expression is not compatible with ''isset'', the existing behaviour continues to be used.

===== Future Scope =====

None I can think of currently.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required. A straight Yes/No vote would be held.

===== Patches and Tests =====

A pull request with a working implementation and test, targeting master, is here: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/809

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== References =====

There have been several previous discussions and proposals about adding an ifsetor operator with similar behaviour, or changing the behaviour of ''?:'', indeed there has been at least one each year:
