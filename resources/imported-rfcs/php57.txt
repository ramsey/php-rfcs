====== PHP RFC: PHP 5.7 ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2014-12-15
  * Author: Andrea Faulds, ajf@ajf.me

===== Introduction =====

There is going to be a new major release of PHP, [[rfc:php6|PHP 7]], and we have agreed on a [[rfc:php7timeline|timeline]] for it. Because it is a major release that breaks backwards-compatibility in some areas, there have been calls to create a final minor release for the PHP 5.x line, PHP 5.7. Such a release would ease the transition from PHP 5 to PHP 7. Firstly, it would give users an extra year of official support for PHP 5. Secondly, it would allow us to add deprecation notices and other warnings for things that will change in PHP 7, in order to give users a chance to update their code.

===== Proposal =====

A final minor version of PHP 5 shall be made, PHP 5.7, to be released at the same time as PHP 7. Its timeline will track that used by PHP 7 (see the [[rfc:php7timeline|PHP 7 Timeline RFC]]):

| 1. **Line up any remaining RFCs that target PHP 5.7.**    | Now - Mar 15 (4+ additional months) |  |
| 2. **Finalize implementation & testing of changes.**      | Mar 16 - Jun 15 (3 months) | |
| 3. **Release Candidate (RC) cycles**                      | Jun 16 - Oct 15 (3 months) | Subject to quality! |
| 4. **GA/Release**                                         | Mid October 2015           | Subject to quality! |

Unlike normal PHP minor versions, no new features may be added to the PHP 5.7 release - any new features must go into PHP 7 instead. However, RFCs targeting PHP 7 may choose to add deprecation notices or other warnings to PHP 5.7, and bug fixes will be allowed as usual.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

The vote will be a straight Yes/No vote with 2/3 majority.
