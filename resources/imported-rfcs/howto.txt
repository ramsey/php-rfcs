====== Request for Comments: How to write RFCs ======

===== Introduction =====

The purpose of RFCs are to work collaboratively towards a specification and finally an implementation of an idea. RFCs provide a means for features to be evaluated, and then rejected or approved by voting.

At the time of writing, there wasn't any real information about the procedure regarding writing an RFC. This RFC is an attempt to document that, consolidating what little information is available, and to set forth a standard procedure. It's a meta-RFC of sorts, not documenting any changes to PHP itself.

===== Proposal (incomplete) =====

Creating an RFC is a multi-stage process:

To write an RFC, a wiki account and karma need to be obtained. First, register for an account at [[https://wiki.php.net/start?do=register]]. Read the instructions: you must email the webmaster to get an account.
