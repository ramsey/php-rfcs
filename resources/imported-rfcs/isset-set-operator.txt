====== PHP RFC: Isset/Set Operator ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2013-11-24
  * Author: Chris London, me chrislondon co
  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

Two new operators. ?= for setting the value of an unset or falsey variable. And ??: which acts like ?: except it it also checks is set.

===== Proposal =====

?= Will be a new operator that allows the user to set an unset or falsey variable. This handy operator will help avoid dreaded unset variable notices.

    $foo ?= 'default';
    
    // which is functionally equivalent to:
    $foo = (isset($foo) && $foo) ? $foo : 'default';
    
    // or
    if (!isset($foo) || !$foo) $foo = 'default';

??: will be equivalent to the ternary short hand ?: except that it also checks for isset().

    $foo = $bar ??: 'other';
    
    // which is functionally equivalent to:
    $foo = (isset($bar) && $foo) ? $bar : $other;
    
This will be very helpful echoing default variables in HTML like so:

    <div class="<?= $user ??: 'guest' ?>"> ... </div>
