====== PHP RFC: Strict operators directive ======

  * Version: 1.4
  * Date: 2020-06-09 (first version: 2019-05-25)
  * Author: Arnold Daniels, <jasny@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion

===== Introduction =====

The rules PHP uses for type juggling with operators are complex, varying by operator as well as the types and values of the operands.

This can lead to surprising results, where a logical statement can have an illogical result. See the "Motivating examples" section below for details.

This RFC proposes a new directive ''%%strict_operators%%'', which limits the type juggling done by operators to avoid unexpected results.

===== Proposal =====

Add a new ''%%declare()%%'' directive ''%%strict_operators%%'', which accepts either ''%%0%%'' or ''%%1%%'' as the value to indicate that the strict_operators mode should be disabled or enabled.

The default value for this directive is 0, i.e. strict_operators not enabled and there will be no change from the current behavior of PHP i.e. by default, PHP files do not use the new strict_operators rules.

If strict_operators is enabled, the following stricter rules will be used;

  * Operators may perform type casting, but not type juggling:
    * Type casting is not based on the type of the other operand
    * Type casting is not based on the value of any of the operands
  * Operators will throw a ''%%TypeError%%'' for unsupported types

In case an operator can work with several (or all) types, the operands need to match as no casting will be done by those operators.

The one exception is that [[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.2|widening primitive conversion]] is allowed for ''%%int%%'' to ''%%float%%''. When doing a operation with an ''%%int%%'' and a ''%%float%%'', the ''%%int%%'' will silently casted to a ''%%float%%''.

===== Details for operands =====

This section details which types operands support, and what type juggling will be supported (if any) for them.

==== Arithmetic operators ====

Arithmetic operators ''%%+%%'', ''%%-%%'', ''%%*%%'', ''%%/%%'', ''%%%%%'', and ''%%**%%'' will only support ''%%int%%'' or ''%%float%%'' operands. Attempting to use an unsupported operand will throw a ''%%TypeError%%''.

The ''%%+%%'' operator will still be available for arrays as union operator, requiring both values to be arrays.

==== Incrementing/Decrementing operators ====

The incrementing/decrementing operators ''%%++%%'' and ''%%--%%'' will only support ''%%int%%'' or ''%%float%%'' operands. Attempting to use an unsupported operand will throw a ''%%TypeError%%''.

==== Bitwise Operators ====

The bitwise operators ''%%&%%'', ''%%|%%'', ''%%^%%'', and ''%%~%%'' will support ''%%int%%'' and ''%%string%%'' operands . The type of both operands need to match. If the operands are of different types or when using an unsupported operand, a ''%%TypeError%%'' will be thrown.

The bitwise shift operators ''%%>>%%'' and ''%%<<%%'' will only support ''%%int%%'' operands. Attempting to use an unsupported operand will throw a ''%%TypeError%%''.

==== Comparison operators ====

Enabling the strict_operators directive will not affect the identical (''%%===%%'') and not identical (''%%!==%%'') operators.

All other comparison operators (''%%==%%'', ''%%!=%%'', ''%%<%%'', ''%%>%%'', ''%%<=%%'', ''%%>=%%'', ''%%<=>%%'') will only support ''%%int%%'' or ''%%float%%'' operands.

When used with a ''%%bool%%'', ''%%string%%'', ''%%array%%'', ''%%object%%'', or ''%%resource%%'' operand, a ''%%TypeError%%'' will be thrown.

==== String concatenation ====

The concatenation operator ''%%.%%'' will only support concatenating ''%%null%%'', ''%%int%%'', ''%%float%%'', ''%%string%%'', and [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/stringable|stringable object]] operands.

If any of the operands is a ''%%bool%%'', ''%%array%%'', ''%%resource%%'', or non-stringable object, a ''%%TypeError%%''will be thrown.

=== String interpolation ===

When a string is specified in double quotes or with heredoc, variables are parsed within it. The string interpolation is performed with the same rules as for string concatenation.

i.e. this code

<code php>
echo "He drank some $juice juice.";
</code>

has the same rules as using the string concatenation operator.

<code php>
echo "He drank some " . $juice . " juice.";
</code>

==== Logical Operators ====

There a no changes to the logical operators ''%%&&%%'', ''%%||%%'', ''%%!%%'', ''%%and%%'', ''%%or%%'', and ''%%xor%%''.

==== Ternary / Null Coalescing Operator ====

There a no changes to the ternary (''%%?:%%'') and null coalescing (''%%??%%'') operator.

===== Switch control structure =====

The strict_operators directive may affect ''%%switch%%''. This is decided through a secondary vote.

The ''%%switch%%'' statement will not perform any type conversion. Comparison will be done similar to the identical (''%%===%%'') operator, rather the equal (''%%==%%'') operator.

<code php>
function match($value)
{
  switch ($value) {
    case ["foo" => 42, "bar" => 1]:
      return "foobar";
      break;
    case null:
      return "null";
      break;
    case 0:
      return "zero";
      break;
    case "1e1":
      return "1e1";
      break;
    case "10":
      return "10";
      break;
    default:
      throw new Exception("Unexpected value");
  }
}

match(["bar" => 1, "foo" => 42]); // "foobar"
match(0);                         // "zero"
match("10");                      // "10"
match("foo");                     // Exception("Unexpected value")
</code>

===== Motivating examples =====

The following section demonstrates code that is written logical, but has illogical results.

==== Mixed type comparison ====

The meaning of comparison operators currently change based on the type of each operand. Strings are compared as byte sequence. If one of the operands is an integer the operator performs a numeric comparison.

This allows for statements that defy mathematical logic and may be experienced as unexpected behavior.

<code php>
$a = '42';
$b = 10;
$c = '9 eur';

if (($a > $b) && ($b > $c) && ($c > $a)) {
   // Unexpected 
}
</code>

==== Numeric string comparison ====

Non-strict comparison uses a "smart" comparison method that treats strings as numbers if they are numeric. The meaning of the operator changes based on the value of both operands.

This can lead to issues when numeric comparison is not expected, for example between two hexidecimal values. The hexidecimal value is instead interpreted as number with scientific notation.

<code>
$red = '990000';
$purple = '9900e2';

$red == $purple; // true
</code>

It may also cause issues with sorting, as the meaning of the comparison operators differers based on the operands (similar to mixed type comparison).

<code php>
function sorted(array $arr) {
  usort($arr, function($x, $y) { return $x <=> $y; });
  return $arr;
}

sorted(['100', '5 eur', '62']); // ['100', '5 eur', '62']
sorted(['100', '62', '5 eur']); // ['5 eur', '62', '100']
sorted(['62', '100', '5 eur']); // ['62', '100', '5 eur']
</code>

==== Array comparison ====

Using the ''%%>%%'', ''%%>=%%'', ''%%<%%'', ''%%<=%%'' and ''%%<=>%%'' operators on arrays or objects that don't have the same keys in the same order gives unexpected results.

In the following example ''%%$a%%'' is both greater than and less than ''%%$b%%''

<code php>
$a = ['x' => 1, 'y' => 22];
$b = ['y' => 10, 'x' => 15];

$a > $b; // true
$a < $b; // true
</code>

The logic of relational operators other than ''%%==%%'', ''%%===%%'', ''%%!=%%'' and ''%%!==%%'' has limited practical use.

==== Strict vs non-strict comparison of arrays ====

Strict comparison requires that arrays have keys occurring in the same order, while non-strict comparison allows out-of-order keys.

<code php>
['a' => 'foo', 'b' => 'bar'] == ['b' => 'bar', 'a' => 0]; // true
</code>

To compare the values of two arrays in a strict way while not concerned about the order, requires ordering the array by key prior to comparison.

==== Switch control structure ====

The ''%%switch%%'' statement does a non-strict comparison. This can lead to unexpected results;

<code php>
function match($value)
{
  switch ($value) {
    case 2:
      return "double";
      break;
    case 1:
      return "single";
      break;
    case 0:
      return "none";
      break;
    default:
      throw new Exception("Unexpected value");
  }
}

match("foo"); // "none"
</code>

==== Inconsistent behavior ====

Operators can do any of the following for unsupported operands

  * Cast (silent)
  * Cast with notice / warning
  * Cast with catchable error (fatal)
  * Operator specific notice / warning
  * Operator specific error (fatal)
  * No operation
