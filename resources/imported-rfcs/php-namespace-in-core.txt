====== PHP RFC: PHP Namespace in core ======
  * Version: 1.1.0
  * Date: 2020-03-25
  * Author: Michał Brzuchalski <brzuchal@php.net>, George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/php-namespace-in-core

===== Introduction =====
The PHP project has reserved the right to use the ''\PHP'' namespace but has never acted upon starting to use it. We therefore propose that core symbols which cannot be unbundled such as those related to the language/parser/interpreter must use ''\PHP'' namespace.

This would provide a way to reduce the usage of the global namespace as "PHP"'s namespace and also provide a way to fix some fundamental misnaming.

This is not a concrete proposal on how to structure the namespace or a proposal on realiasing classes to use the ''\PHP'' namespace. This is only an agreement that core classes or newly introduced symbols which are tightly coupled to the PHP engine must start using the ''\PHP'' namespace, e.g. for type prefixes.

===== Features which could benefit from the PHP namespace =====

  * The recently accepted [[rfc:token_as_object|PHP RFC: Object-based token_get_all() alternative]] uses the <php>\PhpToken</php> class but under this proposal it could be <php>\PHP\PhpToken</php>
  * The currently under discussion [[rfc:attributes_v2|PHP RFC: Attributes v2]] could use the ''\PHP'' namespace for engine/internal related attributes.

As these sort of symbols are tied to the engine there is no risk that they will get unbundled from PHP core and moved to PECL. We note this as we are aware that if a non core extension would use the ''\PHP'' namespace and gets unbundled and moved to PECL we would find ourselves in a situation where symbols under the ''\PHP'' namespace are not always available in PHP.

==== A small toy-example ====
Currently <php>debug_backtrace()</php> produces and array of arrays. An object oriented API could introduce the <php>Frame</php> class to hold details about each frame in the backtrace. As this would be an internal API using the ''\PHP'' namespace this signals clear ownership and possibly limit the BC breaks for users which don't use the namespace feature of PHP.

===== A chance to clean up poor design/naming decisions =====
Currently within the Reflection extension we have the following classes ''ReflectionType'' and ''ReflectionNamedType'' however their purpose isn't exactly to present a type.

From PHP's type system perspective, a class is a type. Therefore, ''ReflectionClass'' not extending from ''ReflectionType'' could be seen as questionable. Thus the ''ReflectionType'' class acts more as a type constraint and renaming it to ''ReflectionTypeConstraint'' may be a good way to clarify it's concern.

This RFC could allow us to redesign, with the benefit of hindsight, some of the core APIs provided by PHP.

Continuing from the previous example we could alias ''ReflectionType'' to the more accurate ''PHP\ReflectionTypeConstraint'' class name, and possibly in the future introduce ''PHP\ReflectionType'' as the top reflector for all kinds of types which may be introduced in the future, e.g. Enums, Generics, etc.

Another infamous example would be some of the data structures provides by the SPL extension. Indeed as <php> SplQueue extends SplDoublyLinkedList</php> this means that <php>SplQueue</php> inherits the <php>push()</php> and <php>pop()</php> methods from <php>SplDoublyLinkedList</php> meaning that if you decide to use these functions instead of the designated <php>enqueue()</php> and <php>dequeue()</php> methods you get something which behave like a stack instead of a queue.

Although some of these concerns may be fixed with the introduction of the [[https://github.com/nikic/php-rfcs/blob/language-evolution/rfcs/0000-language-evolution.md|Language evolution]] RFC as this aspect of the proposal is a redesign once, live with it's imperfection forever. We still believe this may have some valid use cases which are not easily achieved with the fore-mentioned RFC.
 
===== Proposal =====
New features or symbols which are tightly coupled to the internals/engine of the PHP interpreter must use the ''\PHP'' namespace starting from PHP 8.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
No backwards incompatible changes as only new classes/symbols would be introduces under the ''\PHP'' namespace.

===== Proposed PHP Version =====
PHP 8.0.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
The vote is a straight Yes/No vote requiring a 2/3 majority to accept the RFC.

===== Patches and Tests =====
This RFC doesn't provide any changes.

===== Changelog =====
1.0.0: Initial version \\
1.1.0: New features must use the PHP engine, before this was merely a suggestion \\
