====== PHP RFC: Saner numeric strings ======
  * Version: 1.1
  * Date: 2020-06-28
  * Author: George Peter Banyard <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Under Discussion
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/saner-numeric-strings
  * Implementation: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5762

===== Technical Background =====
The PHP language has a concept of //numeric strings//, strings which can be interpreted as numbers. This concept is used in a few places:

  * Explicit conversions of strings to number types, e.g. <PHP>$a = "123";
$b = (float)$a; // float(123)</PHP>
  * Implicit conversions of strings to number types, e.g. in weak typing mode <PHP>$a = "123";
$b = intdiv($a, 1); // int(123)</PHP>
  * Comparisons, e.g. <PHP>$a = "123";
$b = "123.0";
$c = ($a == $b); // bool(true)</PHP>
  * The <php>\is_numeric()</php> function, e.g. <PHP>$a = "123";
$b = \is_numeric($a); // bool(true)</PHP>

A string can be categorised in three ways according to its numeric-ness, as [[https://github.com/php/php-langspec/blob/be010b4435e7b0801737bb66b5bbdd8f9fb51dde/spec/05-types.md#the-string-type|described by the language specification]]:

  * A //numeric string// is a string containing only a [[https://github.com/php/php-langspec/blob/be010b4435e7b0801737bb66b5bbdd8f9fb51dde/spec/05-types.md#grammar-str-number|number]], optionally preceded by white-space characters. For example, <php>"123"</php> or <php>"  1.23e2"</php>.
  * A //leading-numeric string// is a string that begins with a numeric string but is followed by non-number characters  (including white-space characters). For example, <php>"123abc"</php> or <php>"123 "</php>.
  * A //non-numeric string// is a string which is neither a numeric string nor a leading-numeric string.

The difference between a numeric string and a leading-numeric string is significant, because certain operations distinguish between these:

  * <php>\is_numeric()</php> returns <php>TRUE</php> only for numeric strings
  * Arithmetic operations (e.g. <php>$a * $b</php>, <php>$a + $b</php>) accept and implicitly convert both numeric and leading-numeric strings, but trigger the <php>E_NOTICE</php> “A non well formed numeric value encountered” for leading-numeric strings
  * When ''strict_types=1'' is not set, <php>int</php> and <php>float</php> parameter and return type declarations will accept and implicitly convert both numeric and leading-numeric strings, but likewise trigger the same <php>E_NOTICE</php>
  * Type casts and other explicit conversions to integer or float (e.g. <php>(int)</php>, <php>(float)</php>, <php>settype()</php>) accept all strings, converting both numeric and leading-numeric strings and producing 0 for non-numeric strings
  * String-to-string comparisons with <php>==</php> etc. perform numeric comparison if only both strings are numeric strings
  * String-to-int/float comparisons with <php>==</php> etc. type-juggle the string (and thus perform numeric comparison) if it is either a numeric string or a non-numeric string

It is notable that while a numeric string may contain leading white-space, only a leading-numeric string may contain trailing white-space.

===== The Problem =====

The current behaviour of numerical strings has various issues:
  * numeric strings with leading white-space are considered more numeric than numeric strings with trailing white-space
  * strings which happen to start with a digit, e.g. hashes, may at times be interpreted as numbers, which can lead to bugs
  * <php>\is_numeric()</php> is relatively useless as if one accepts leading/trailing white-spaces one must still manually check for trailing white-spaces, this is also true for the opposite
  * leading-numeric strings is a rather strange concept and an unintuitive/surprising behaviour.

===== Proposal =====

Drop the concept of leading-numeric strings and allow trailing white-spaces for all numeric strings.

This means, all strings which currently emit the <php>E_NOTICE</php> “A non well formed numeric value encountered” will emit the <php>E_WARNING</php> “A non-numeric value encountered” //except// if the leading-numeric string contained only trailing white-spaces. 

For the PHP interpreter, this would be accomplished by modifying the ''is_numeric_string'' C function (and its variants) in the Zend Engine. This would therefore affect PHP features which make use of this function, including:

  * [[rfc:invalid_strings_in_arithmetic|Arithmetic operators]]
  * The <php>int</php> and <php>float</php> type declarations
  * Type checks for built-in/extension (“internal”) PHP functions
  * The comparison operators will now consider numeric strings with trailing white-space to be numeric, therefore meaning that, for example, <php>"123  " == "  123"</php> produces <php>true</php>, instead of <php>false</php>
  * The <php>\is_numeric</php> function would return <php>true</php> for numeric strings with trailing white-space
  * The <php>++</php> and <php>--</php> operators would convert numeric strings with trailing white-space to integers or floats, as appropriate, rather than applying the alphanumeric increment rules

The PHP language specification's [[https://github.com/php/php-langspec/blob/master/spec/05-types.md#the-string-type|definition of str-numeric]] would be modified by the addition of ''str-whitespace''<sub>''opt''</sub> after ''str-number'' and the removal of the following sentence: "A leading-numeric string is a string whose initial characters follow the requirements of a numeric string, and whose trailing characters are non-numeric".

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
There are two backward incompatible changes:
  * code relying on numerical strings with trailing white-spaces to be considered non-well-formed
  * code with liberal use of leading-numerical strings will need to be updated

The first reason is a precise requirement and therefore should be checked explicitly.

Breaking the second reason will allow to catch various bugs ahead of time, and the previous behaviour can be obtained by adding explicit casts, e.g.:
<PHP>
var_dump((int) "2px"); // int(2)
var_dump((float) "2px"); // float(2)
var_dump((int) "2.5px"); // int(2)
var_dump((float) "2.5px"); // float(2.5)
</PHP>

===== Proposed PHP Version =====
PHP 8.0.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To Existing Extensions ====
Any extension using the C ''is_numeric_string'', its variants, or other functions which themselves use it, will be affected.

==== To Opcache ====
None that I am aware of.

===== Unaffected PHP Functionality =====
This does not affect the filter extension, which handles numeric strings itself in a different fashion.

===== Future Scope =====
  * Nikita Popov's [[rfc:string_to_number_comparison|PHP RFC: Saner string to number comparisons]]
  * Adding an E_NOTICE for numerical strings with leading/trailing white-spaces
  * Adding a flag to <php>\is_numeric</php> to accept or reject numerical strings with leading/trailing white-spaces

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
Per the Voting RFC, there would be a single Yes/No vote requiring a 2/3 majority.

===== Patches and Tests =====
A pull request for a complete PHP interpreter patch, including a test file, can be found here: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/5762

A language specification patch still needs to be done.

A possible documentation patch still needs to be done.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
  - a link to the language specification section (if any)
