===== Introduction =====
PHP current array-access system works very well when attempting to access containers of type array, reference(to an array), and objects that implement ArrayAccess.  However, accessing elements not of those types results in a NULL value returned without any alert as to why it's null.  This feature has been requested in [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=37676|37676]] and duplicated in at least [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39915|39915]] and [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72636|72636]].  PHP correctly returns a warning when you attempt to use an offset that is of an invalid type, PHP should also provide a warning when a container is of an invalid type.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposed to combine a couple of existing PR's[[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/notice-for-non-valid-array-container#references|[1]]][[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/notice-for-non-valid-array-container#references|[2]]] as well as my implementation to raise a E_WARNING when a container type is used that does not contain array-accessable data.  The default behavior, of a silent NULL return, is not correctly defined in the [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php|Array Documentation]] however is noted in a [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php#111367|comment]]

As compared to the previous PR's (referenced below) this proposed implementation takes effort to limit throwing errors multiple times.

<file php>
<?php
$var = false;
$var[1][2][3][4][5]; // This will throw a single E_WARNING, as accessing ($a[1])[2] 
                     // is attempting to access a IS_VAR chain that is NULL.
                     // Output would be:
                     // Warning: Variable of type boolean does not accept array offsets
                     
$var = array(123);
$var[0][1];          // This will throw an E_WARNING, as accessing $a[0] is valid
                     // [1] is accessing an integer as an array.                     
                     // Output would be:
                     // Warning: Variable of type integer does not accept array offsets
</file>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
In terms of error-reporting for default INI settings there would be no BC-break for production, but there would be warnings for development.  Many production deployments alter default INI settings for error-reporting and as such could be exposed to this warning displaying.  This would need to be documented in release notes for users to properly address in development environments.

However, error-reporting isn't the only aspect that needs to be addressed here.  ''set_error_handler()'', if listening to E_WARNING will be triggered for this warning regardless of INI settings.  As well ''error_get_last()'' would also contain this warning if it was the most recent error.  These two operate regardless of ''error_reporting(0)''.

This RFC aims to limit the quantity of warnings on a single line, however, large projects may have many locations that might need variable type checking around unknown container access.  Typically, one might assume access of a variable to be an array or object, and could do checks to make sure the variable about to be accessed is an array, or an object.

===== Performance Impact =====
Test run was:
<file php>
<?php
$a = false;
for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i++) {
    $a[0];
}
</file>

Execution Time (DualCore 3ghz; 2g ram)
  * Current Master : ~0.09s (~489k operations)
  * Current Master w/RFC Displaying Warnings: ~33.25s
  * Current Master w/RFC Hiding Warnings: ~0.82s (~4.091m operations)

We can see there is a significant increase in operations on huge loads.  However, I wouldn't suspect 1m of these errors per request almost ever.  So, yes there is; but I'd call it useful information overhead.

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No expected impact to SAPI's

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No Extensions

==== To Opcache ====
No Opcodes are touched with this RFC

==== To Documentation ====
It would probably be nice to document the E_WARNING behavior for accessing on non-array types in the Array Documentation either [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php#language.types.array.syntax.accessing|here]] or [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php#language.types.array.donts|here]]

===== Discussed Issues =====
==== E_NOTICE or E_WARNING ====
I began this RFC with the implementation raising an E_NOTICE.  However, when attempting to access a scalar value as array for a [[https://github.com/bp1222/php-src/blob/7369cfcc0f215156eafae71e2b62a573512b3d05/Zend/zend_execute.c#L1776|write-context]] it raises an E_WARNING.  So I'm mimicking this behavior when accessing any scalar not just those <= IS_FALSE on a read-context.

==== NULL Identity ====
Should NULL variables be treated as a special identity so that accessing array on a null just returns null.  
  * **Pro:** easier checking by doing a ''if (!is_scalar($var))'', before doing access since NULL is not a scalar.
  * **Con:** I'd like to know if I'm accessing a null wrong.

==== list() access ====
Should we ignore throwing warnings for list() accesses? (where ''$foo = null'')
  * ''list($a, $b) == $foo'' -- Warn for each list element?  First?
  * ''foreach(list($a, $b) = each($foo))'' -- Would need to prevent warn on 'final' null each

Per discussion on the [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2031#issuecomment-238366706|PR]] I have limited this RFC to not raise warnings when setting any value by use of list().

==== Reference Assignment Access ====
Discussed on the [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2031#issuecomment-238939626|PR]] was how to handle access like

<file php>
$value = null;
$dim = 0;
$new_val =& $value[$dim];
var_dump($value);
/*
   Output:
   array(1) {
     [0] =>
     &NULL
   }
*/
</file>

In the above example the variable ''$null'' is accessed via write, and current operations there instruct the variable to become an array, where $value[$dim] is created as null, and then make it a reference.  I dislike how this is unique to NULL values being accessed, wherein bools/floats/ints silently fail, and the return value is undefined.  Regardless, because this is accessed as a write, it falls outside the scope of this RFC which aims to raise a warning for read access.
