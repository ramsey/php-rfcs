====== PHP RFC: E_NOTICE for invalid container array-access ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2016-07-27
  * Author: David Walker (dave@mudsite.com)
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/notice-for-non-valid-array-container

===== Introduction =====
PHP current array-access system works very well when attempting to access containers of type array, reference(to an array), and objects that implement ArrayAccess.  However, accessing elements not of those types results in a NULL value returned without any alert as to why it's null.  This feature has been requested in [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=37676|37676]] and duplicated in at least [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39915|39915]] and [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72636|72636]].  PHP correctly returns a notice when you attempt to use an offset that is of an invalid type, PHP should also provide a notice when a container is of an invalid type.

===== Proposal =====
All the features and examples of the proposal.

To [[http://news.php.net/php.internals/66051|paraphrase Zeev Suraski]], explain hows the proposal brings substantial value to be considered
for inclusion in one of the world's most popular programming languages.

Remember that the RFC contents should be easily reusable in the PHP Documentation.

This RFC proposed to combine a couple of existing PR's as well as my implementation to raise a E_NOTICE when a container type is used that does not contain array-accessable data.  The default behavior, of a silent NULL return, is not correctly defined in the [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php|Array Documentation]] however is noted in a [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php#111367|comment]]
