===== Introduction =====
PHP current array-access system works very well when attempting to access containers of type array, reference(to an array), and objects that implement ArrayAccess.  However, accessing elements not of those types results in a NULL value returned without any alert as to why it's null.  This feature has been requested in [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=37676|37676]] and duplicated in at least [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39915|39915]] and [[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72636|72636]].  PHP correctly returns a notice when you attempt to use an offset that is of an invalid type, PHP should also provide a notice when a container is of an invalid type.

===== Proposal =====
This RFC proposed to combine a couple of existing PR's[[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/notice-for-non-valid-array-container#references|[1]]][[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/notice-for-non-valid-array-container#references|[2]]] as well as my implementation to raise a E_NOTICE when a container type is used that does not contain array-accessable data.  The default behavior, of a silent NULL return, is not correctly defined in the [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php|Array Documentation]] however is noted in a [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php#111367|comment]]

As compared to the previous PR's (referenced below) this proposed implementation takes effort to limit throwing errors multiple times.

<file php>
<?php
$var = false;
$var[1][2][3][4][5]; // This will throw a single E_NOTICE, as accessing ($a[1])[2] 
                     // is attempting to access a IS_VAR chain that is NULL.
                     // Output would be:
                     // Notice: Variable of type boolean does not accept array offsets
                     
$var = array(123);
$var[0][1];          // This will throw an E_NOTICE, as accessing $a[0] is valid
                     // [1] is accessing an integer as an array.                     
                     // Output would be:
                     // Notice: Variable of type integer does not accept array offsets
</file>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
In terms of error-reporting for default INI settings there would be no BC-break for production, but there would be notices for development.  Many production deployments alter default INI settings for error-reporting and as such could be exposed to this notice displaying.  This would need to be documented in release notes for users to properly address in development environments.

However, error-reporting isn't the only aspect that needs to be addressed here.  ''set_error_handler()'', if listening to E_NOTICE will be triggered for this notice regardless of INI settings.  As well ''error_get_last()'' would also contain this notice if it was the most recent error.  These two operate regardless of ''error_reporting(0)''.

This RFC aims to limit the quantity of notices on a single line, however, large projects may have many locations that might need variable type checking around unknown container access.  Typically, one might assume access of a variable to be an array or object, and could do checks to make sure the variable about to be accessed is an array, or an object.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
Next PHP 7.x (currently 7.2)

===== RFC Impact =====
==== To SAPIs ====
No expected impact to SAPI's

==== To Existing Extensions ====
No Extensions

==== To Opcache ====
No Opcodes are touched with this RFC

===== Open Issues =====
Previous discussion in this thread [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/notice-for-non-valid-array-container#references|[3]]]

==== NULL Identity ====
Should NULL variables be treated as a special identity so that accessing array on a null just returns null.  
  * **Pro:** easier checking by doing a ''if (!is_scalar($var))'', before doing access since NULL is not a scalar.
  * **Con:** I'd like to know if I'm accessing a null wrong.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
No syntax is changed, a vote of 50%+1 will be necessary
