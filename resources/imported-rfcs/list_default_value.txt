====== PHP RFC:  Default Value in List Syntax ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2015-11-08
  * Author: Reeze Xia, reeze@php.net
  * Status: Draft
  * First Published at: http://wiki.php.net/rfc/list_default_value

===== Introduction =====
We could destruct variables from an array with [[http://php.net/list| list constuct]], it may be nested or a simple array. But there is no guarantee that the array can fulfill all variables, it will be simple assigned with null with notice error (not good). We will need several redundant code to handle the possible cases if we want to check it and assign it with default values. 

For the similar purpose we introduced  [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php#language.operators.comparison|Null coalesce "??"]] and [[http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php#language.operators.comparison.ternary|Ternary Operator "?:"]] to help write clean code.

Some clever users figured out  some workaround like this  [[http://php.net/manual/en/function.list.php#113189|User contributed notes]]. But that is not good enough and ugly.

===== Proposal =====

Support new syntax to set default value for list elements, when there the requested index it not found in array:

<code php>
list($a, $b='default') = [1];      // a = 1, b = 'default'
list($a, $b='default') = [1, 2];  // a = 1, b = 2


function say_hello()
{
    return "Hello";
}
$name = 'PHP';
list($a=say_hell(), $b=$name."7.0") = []; // a = 'Hello', b = 'PHP7.0'

list($a, list($b=1, $c=2)) = [1]; // a = 1, b = 1, c = 2

</code>

The assignment could be considered as a shortcut for:

<code php>

list($a, $b='deafult') = $arr;

// equals

$a = $arr[0];
$b = isset($arr[1]) ? $arr[1] : 'default';
</code>

This seems not a lot of work than the new syntax. But sometimes we need to destruct nested array and there are morn than two variables, anyway list() itself is designed to avoid assign by hand for short and clean code.


The syntax is:

<code flex>
assignment_list_element:
		variable				
+	|	variable '=' expr # the new syntax. value could be any expression
	|	T_LIST '(' assignment_list ')'
	|	/* empty */				
</code>

The syntax is same as function's default value for parameters.


We could also set default value in foreach list context:

<code php>
foreach($arr as list($k, list($v1='deafult', $v2='default2'))) {
    // do something
}
</code>

More case could be found from PR's tests:  [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1623/files]]

This feature could also be found in [[https://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/clojure/destructuring/|Clojure]] and [[https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-destructuring/|Javascript]] for destructing.
