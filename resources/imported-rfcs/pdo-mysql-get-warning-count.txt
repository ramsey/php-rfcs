====== PHP RFC: Add PDO function: mysqlGetWarningCount ======

===== Introduction =====
Knowing if a query you ran generated warnings in your database is very important. MySQL warns about values getting truncated, inserting nulls into not-null columns and lots of other things. PDO currently makes discovering these warnings harder and more expensive than it needs to be. Right now, this requires running **another query** (''SHOW WARNINGS'') after each query, incurring another round trip over the network to the database. It turns out that MySQL already provides the warning count in the meta-data of every result set, but PDO doesn't make it accessible.

===== Proposal =====
Add a function that exposes the warning count of the most recent statement for MySQL: ''$pdo->mysqlGetWarningCount()''. It returns an ''int'' straight from the MySQL driver.

===== Caveat =====
I didn't look at every one, but most other SQL drivers don't seem to have a concept of "SHOW WARNINGS" and thus this feature (getting the warning count) only really applies to MySQL.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====
None

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====
I made the pull-request against 7.4, but this is applicable to all php versions.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====
"Yes" means this pull should be merged (pending code review). "No" means we don't want PDO to expose MySQLs warning count.

===== Patches and Tests =====
There's an open pull with tests: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/6677
