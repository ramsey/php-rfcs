===== Introduction =====

Many languages currently support metadata information. This RFC exposes an idea about how can it be implemented in PHP, providing a powerful tool that many applications can take advantage of.

==== Why do we need Class Metadata? ====

Frameworks in general rely on metadata information in order to correctly work. They can use it for many purposes:

  * **phpUnit** Providing meta functionality for test cases, examples: @dataProvider for test data iteration, @expectedException for catching exceptions, etc.
  * **Doctrine** For Object-Relational mapping, examples: @Entity, @OneToOne, @Id, etc.
  * **Zend Framework Server classes** Used to automate mappings for XML-RPC, SOAP, etc.
  * **FLOW3** for dependency injection and validation
  * **Symfony2** for routing rules
  * **Others** One clear thing that comes to my mind is Validation, Functional Behavior injection (which could take advantage of [[rfc:Traits]]), etc. Also, any Framework could take advantage of it somehow.

So, any meta mapping injection could be easily achieved via the implementation of a centralized Annotations support.

The .NET framework uses Data Annotation:
[[http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/validation-with-the-data-annotation-validators-cs]]

An advantage here is the .net framework will process some annotations and inject behavior into the compiled source code.

It's important to note that annotations exist in java and .net but many strong use cases exist in these languages to provide hints to the compiler (@NotNull).

These types of use cases (hints to the Zend lexer/parser or other PHP implementations) are not presented in this RFC.

===== Common Misconceptions =====

Metadata mapping is commonly referred an feature that cannot be used widely, so its implementation is useless.
As pointed previously, there are many use cases for this support. 

Though useful, the good and bad use cases of annotations are heavily debated (religiously):

[[http://willcode4beer.com/design.jsp?set=annotations_gotchas_best_practices]]

[[http://www.softwarereality.com/programming/annotations.jsp]]

===== Proposal =====

First thing to be decided would be the tokens to be used for categorize an Annotation.

  * Java uses [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation|Annotations]]
  * C# uses [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_metadata|Attributes]]

When using meta mapping, less characters is preferred to speed up its construction.

PHP Annotation could be simplified into this EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form):

<code>
Annotations     ::= Annotation {Annotation}*
Annotation      ::= "<" AnnotationName ["(" [Values] ")"] ">"
AnnotationName  ::=  QualifiedName | SimpleName
QualifiedName   ::= {"\"}* NameSpacePart "\" {NameSpacePart "\"}* SimpleName
NameSpacePart   ::= identifier
SimpleName      ::= identifier
Alias           ::= identifier
Values          ::= Value {"," Value}*
Value           ::= integer | string | float | boolean | Array | Annotation
Array           ::= "array(" ArrayEntry {"," ArrayEntry}* ")"
ArrayEntry      ::= Value | KeyValuePair
KeyValuePair    ::= Key "=>" Value
Key             ::= string | integer
</code>

With integer, string, float, boolean, float and identifier being the terminals. Identifier: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

The start/end tokens are not closed, they can be changed if anyone desires. Currently the chosen ones are: "<" for start token and ">" for end.
Here is an example of PHP Annotations:

<code>
<Entity("users")>
class User
{
    <Column("integer")>
    <Id>
    <GeneratedValue("AUTO")>
    protected $id;

    // ...

    <ManyToMany("Phonenumber")>
    protected $Phonenumbers;
}
</code>

One point to notice is that nested Annotations are allowed. This is an important feature against key=>value pair of what docblock implementations currently define. 
Here is a simple sample of usage:

<code php>
<Simple(<Example>)>
class User {
    // ...
}
</code>

The support is all done through the inclusion of a new class: ReflectionAnnotation.


===== How to define Annotations =====

Annotations can be defined on classes, methods, properties, functions or function parameters.
ReflectionAnnotation is an interface the must be implemented in order to accept an Annotation definition.
Once this class is extended, the subclass is ready to be used an an Annotation:

<code php>
class Foo implements \ReflectionAnnotation {
    public $value;

    public function __construct($value)
    {
        $this->value = $value;
    }
}

<Foo(array(true))>
class Bar { /* ... */ }
</code>

To have access to an Annotation instance, it is done through Reflection API.

<code php>
$reflClass = new \ReflectionClass('Bar');
$reflAnnot = $reflClass->getAnnotation('Foo');

echo $foo->value; // array(true)
</code>

To expand Annotations support, it is allowed to define other properties.
By doing it, you can define Annotations and automatically defining values to constructor.

<code php>
namespace App\Annotation;

class Link implements \ReflectionAnnotation {
    public $url;
    public $target;
    
    public function __construct($url, $target)
    {
        $this->url = $url;
        $this->target = $target;
    }
}

namespace App;

<Annotation\Link("http://www.php.net", "_blank")>
class PHPWebsite {
    // ...
}
</code>

Please notice that Annotations can also take advantage of "use" and "namespace" definitions.
Example:

<code php>
namespace Foo\Bar;

<Exception("I should not do this")>
<\Exception("And also this one is ugly")>
class Playground {
    // ...
}

// Exception points to \Foo\Bar\Exception
// \Exception points to \Exception
</code>

===== How to retrieve Annotation information =====

Annotations are only useful if defined information can be retrieved somehow.
Example:

<code php>
class Author implements \ReflectionAnnotation {
    public $name;
    
    public function __construct($name) { $this->name = $name; }
}

<Author("Pierrick Charron")>
class MyTest {
    <Author("Guilherme Blanco")>
    public function __toString()
    {
        // ...
    }
}

class ExtendedTest extends MyTest {}
</code>

When you attempt to retrieve the defined information for classes A and B, you get:

<code php>
$reflClassA = new \ReflectionClass('MyTest');
var_dump($reflClassA->getAnnotations());
/*
array(1) {
  ["Author"]=>
  object(Author)#%d (1) {
    ["name"]=> string (16) "Pierrick Charron"
  }
}
*/

$reflMethodToString = $reflClassA->getMethod('__toString');
var_dump($reflMethodToString->getAnnotations());
/*
array(1) {
  ["Author"]=>
  object(Author)#%d (1) {
    ["name"]=> string (16) "Guilherme Blanco"
  }
}
*/

$reflClassB = new \ReflectionClass('ExtendedTest');
var_dump($reflClassB->getAnnotations());
/*
array(0) {
}
*/
</code>

Please notice that multiple instantiation of same Annotation is left intentionally for discussion. It can be supported.
Also, the inheritance of Annotations is left for discussion too. This can be done by 2 different approaches:

  * Using an Annotation at the top of ReflectionAnnotation definition. This was it was working on first patch.
  * Using a different interface to be implemented. This was another approach that we considered, but left for discussion.

Another available method is to retrieve an specific Annotation: `getAnnotation($name)`, which may return the matched Annotation or null if not found.

At the level of a single code element (property, class, method...), you'll always get one single instance of a given annotation. This means that if you call getAnnotation multiple times on the same element, you'll always get the same instance.

Basically, these are the extended methods in Reflection API, written in raw PHP:

<code php>
interface ReflectionAnnotation {
}

class ReflectionFunction {
    // ...

    public function getAnnotations();
    public function getAnnotation($name);
    public function hasAnnotation($name);
}

class ReflectionClass {
    // ...

    public function getAnnotations();
    public function getAnnotation($name);
    public function hasAnnotation($name);
}

class ReflectionProperty {
    // ...

    public function getAnnotations();
    public function getAnnotation($name);
    public function hasAnnotation($name);
}

class ReflectionMethod {
    // ...

    public function getAnnotations();
    public function getAnnotation($name);
    public function hasAnnotation($name);
}

class ReflectionParameter {
    // ...

    public function getAnnotations();
    public function getAnnotation($name);
    public function hasAnnotation($name);
}
</code>

===== BC breaks =====

   * Creates one additional classes named "ReflectionAnnotation" that may break existing code.
   * None otherwise (no new keywords)

===== To be discussed =====

  * Possible usage of "annotation" as keyword instead of an abstract class.
  * Tokens for start/end. Currently it's "<" and ">".
  * Nested Annotation declaration: <Foo(<Bar>)> or <Foo(new Bar)> (this changes the EBNF if any change is agreed). Currently the supported one is: <Foo(<Bar>)>
  * Multiple instantiations of Annotation classes on a same block.
  * Inheritance of classes/properties/method and Annotations declarations.
