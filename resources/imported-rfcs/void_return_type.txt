===== Introduction =====

The [[rfc:return_types|Return Types]] RFC has introduced return types to PHP. While there is already a means to specify that any value may be returned (by omitting the return type), there is no way to specify that //no// value should be returned, unlike many other languages with return types. This is unfortunate, as this can be useful for documentation and error-checking purposes. In particular, it makes it clear that a function performs an action, rather than producing a result. This RFC proposes the introduction of a ''void'' return type for this purpose, similar to that in other programming languages.

===== Proposal =====

Support for a new ''void'' return type is added. It requires that a function not return any value:

<code php>
function should_return_nothing(): void {
    return 1; // Fatal error: A void function must not return a value
}
</code>

Unlike other return types which are enforced when a function is called, this type is checked at compile-time, which means that an error is produced without the function needing to be called.

A function with a ''void'' return type, or //void function//, may either return implicitly, or have a return statement without a value:

<code php>
function lacks_return(): void {
    // valid
}
</code>

<code php>
function returns_nothing(): void {
    return; // valid
}
</code>

A void function may not return a value:

<code php>
function returns_one(): void {
    return 1; // Fatal error: A void function must not return a value
}
</code>

<code php>
function returns_null(): void {
    return null; // Fatal error: A void function must not return a value
}
</code>

Note that ''void'' is only valid as a return type, not as a parameter type:

<code php>
function foobar(void $foo) { // Fatal error: void cannot be used as a parameter type
}
</code>

A ''void'' return type cannot be changed during inheritance. You can see this as either because return types are invariant, or because they are covariant and nothing is a subclass of ''void''.

<code php>
class Foo
{
    public function bar(): void {
    }
}

class Foobar extends Foo
{
    public function bar(): array { // Fatal error: Declaration of Foobar::bar() must be compatible with Foo::bar(): void
    }
}
</code>

===== Rationale =====

==== Why check at compile-time? ====

Generally-speaking, you should warn of problems sooner rather than later. It just so happens that it's trivial (a three-line change) to make PHP to check this at compile-time rather than run-time. So, this proposal suggests just that.

==== Why isn't ''return null;'' permitted? ====

Some people have asked about this, since ''return;'' and ''return null;'' are technically equivalent in PHP; when a return value isn't specified, PHP will produce ''null'' for you. However, choosing one over the other suggests intent. If you specify a value, it suggests the value is significant. In a void function, the return value is insignificant: it's always the same and has no actual usefulness. Specifying it explicitly with ''return null;'' is pointless, because it doesn't really matter what value the function is going to return.

Since ''void'' signifies an unimportant return value that won't be used, this proposal requires you to not specify one. This extends to ''null'' just as it does to any other value.

==== Use of void functions in expressions ====

In some other languages, such as C, a void function can't be used in an expression, only as a statement. Since this RFC adds a way to specify a void function to PHP's syntax, it might be expected the same restriction would now apply in PHP. However, this wouldn't match precedent. PHP has had 'void functions' of a kind since its inception, in the form of built-in functions, which are documented as "void" in the manual. Such functions //can// be used in expressions, unlike in C.

We could change PHP's rules on void functions and disallow their use in expressions, but this would create a backwards-compatibility issue: it's not inconceivable that existing PHP code relies on being able to call built-in void functions in expressions, and plenty of code assumes that you can take the return value of an arbitrary PHP function (a callback, perhaps).

Moreover, IDEs and other tools can warn the user when the return value of a void function is being used. It isn't strictly necessary for the language itself to cover this.

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Like the names reserved by the [[rfc:scalar_type_hints_v5|Scalar Type Declarations]] and [[rfc:reserve_more_types_in_php_7|Reserve More Types in PHP 7]] RFCs, the ''void'' return type does not become a reserved word proper, but is instead restricted from use in class and interface names. This avoids confusion while minimising backwards-compatibility issues. I do not expect that ''Void'' is a very common class name, and so the backwards-compatibility impact should be limited.

===== Proposed PHP Version(s) =====

This is proposed for the next minor version of PHP, currently PHP 7.1.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required. The vote is a straight Yes/No vote for accepting the RFC and merging the patch.

===== Patches and Tests =====

There is a patch for php-src's master branch with tests: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1084

There is currently no patch for the language specification.

===== Implementation =====
After the project is implemented, this section should contain 
  - the version(s) it was merged to
  - a link to the git commit(s)
  - a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature

===== Changelog =====
