Prevent Number_format() From Returning Negative Zero
====================================================

:PHP-RFC: 0546
:Title: Prevent Number_format() From Returning Negative Zero
:Author: Craig Duncan <php@duncanc.co.uk>
:Status: Implemented
:Type: Standards Track
:Created: 2017-04-01
:PHP-Version: 7.2
:Version: 0.1

Introduction
------------

Calling ``number_format(-0.00)`` returns ``string(1) "0"``, however
calling ``number_format(-0.01)`` returns ``string(2) "-0"``.

As ``number_format()`` is commonly used for formatting numbers for
human-readable display, this behaviour is unexpected.

Proposal
--------

This RFC proposes keeping ``number_format()`` consistent and not
displaying the sign when a number is rounded to zero.

Concerns
--------

There was an argument that all floating point logic in PHP follows IEEE
754, where negative zero is valid.

However ``number_format()`` already prevents negative zero, so this
isn't the case.

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

This change has BC concerns for anybody relying on the current
behaviour, but this is thought to be incredibly minor and not
unrealistic for a point release.

Proposed PHP Version(s)
-----------------------

PHP 7.2

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Simple Yes/No vote that doesn't change the language itself so requires
50% + 1 votes to get 'accepted'.
