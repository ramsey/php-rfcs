Abolish Short Votes
===================

:PHP-RFC: 0642
:Title: Abolish Short Votes
:Author: krakjoe
:Status: Active
:Type: Process
:Created: 2019-03-21
:Version: 0.1

Introduction
------------

Under the Voting section of the current `Voting RFC </rfc/voting>`__ it
states:

    The voting has minimal period of 1 week, which can be extended when
    circumstances warrant it.

The ambiguous language used here means that some contributors feel
comfortable bringing big features to vote with only a one week period of
voting.

At this point in the life of PHP, there is no good reason to squeeze a
vote into a single week, our release schedule (and flexibility thereof)
allows us to allocate two weeks for any vote.

Proposal
--------

The above quoted text shall be removed from the Voting RFC and replaced
with:

    Votes should be open for two weeks at minimum, at the authors
    discretion this may be extended, for example during holiday periods.

    A valid voting period must be declared when voting is started and
    must not be changed during the vote.

Should this RFC pass, the version number of the Voting RFC shall be
amended, the rest of the document shall remain unchanged.
