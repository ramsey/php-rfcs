:Status: Draft

:Version: 1.0

Introduction
------------

The RFC proposes to deprecate the listed functionalities in PHP 8.2 and
remove them in PHP 9.

The following list provides a short overview of the functionality
targeted for deprecation, while more detailed explanation is provided in
the Proposal section:

-  Call scope dependent behavior of internal methods

Proposal
--------

Each feature proposed for deprecation is voted separately and requires a
2/3 majority. All votes refer to deprecation in PHP 8.2 and removal in
PHP 9.0.

Call scope dependent behavior of internal methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few internal methods return different values based on the scope they
were called from:

-  XMLReader::open()
-  XMLReader::XML()
-  DOMElement::setAttribute()
-  DOMDocument::load()
-  DOMDocument::loadHTML()
-  DOMDocument::loadHTMLFile()
-  DOMDocument::loadXML()

These methods should be allowed to be called either statically, or from
the object scope, and their behavior shouldn't depend on the scope.
