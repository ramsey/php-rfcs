Introduction
------------

This RFC is about removing the curl stream wrappers of the PHP as of 5.5
and to move it on PECL for any eventual improvements.

What this RFC is not about
--------------------------

This RFC is not about removing ext/curl from PHP.

What is the curl stream wrappers feature
----------------------------------------

The curl-stream-wrappers feature is a replacement for the php's stream
implemenation, for fopen and other file_get_contents, not the curl_\*
functions.

Why should we remove it
-----------------------

-  This feature has been marked as experimental for years and never
   turned to stable
-  Most people using it just do so by accident
-  This experimental feature should be moved in a new PECL extension for
   improvements until it gets stable
