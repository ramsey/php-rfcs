Technical Background
--------------------

The PHP language has a concept of *numeric strings*, strings which can
be interpreted as numbers. This concept is used in a few places:

-  Explicit conversions of strings to number types, e.g.
   ``$a = "123"; $b = (float)$a; // float(123)``
-  Implicit conversions of strings to number types, e.g.
   ``$a = "123"; $b = intdiv($a, 1); // int(123)`` (if
   ``strict_types=1`` is not set)
-  Comparisons, e.g.
   ``$a = "123"; $b = "123.0"; $c = ($a == $b); // bool(true)``
-  The ``is_numeric()`` function, e.g.
   ``$a = "123"; $b = is_numeric($a); // bool(true)``

A string can be categorised in three ways according to its numericness,
as `described by the language
specification <https://github.com/php/php-langspec/blob/be010b4435e7b0801737bb66b5bbdd8f9fb51dde/spec/05-types.md#the-string-type>`__:

-  A *numeric string* is a string containing only a
   `number <https://github.com/php/php-langspec/blob/be010b4435e7b0801737bb66b5bbdd8f9fb51dde/spec/05-types.md#grammar-str-number>`__,
   optionally preceded by whitespace characters. For example, ``"123"``
   or ``"  1.23e2"``.
-  A *leading-numeric string* is a string that begins with a numeric
   string but is followed by non-number characters (including whitespace
   characters). For example, ``"123abc"`` or ``"123 "``.
-  A *non-numeric string* is a string which is neither a numeric string
   nor a leading-numeric string.

The difference between a numeric string and a leading-numeric string is
significant, because certain operations distinguish between these:

-  ``is_numeric()`` returns ``TRUE`` only for numeric strings
-  Arithmetic operations (e.g. ``$a * $b``, ``$a + $b``) accept and
   implicitly convert both numeric and leading-numeric strings, but
   trigger the ``E_NOTICE`` “A non well formed numeric value
   encountered” for leading-numeric strings
-  When ``strict_types=1`` is not set, ``int`` and ``float`` parameter
   and return type declarations will accept and implicitly convert both
   numeric and leading-numeric strings, but likewise trigger the same
   ``E_NOTICE``
-  Type casts and other explicit conversions to integer or float (e.g.
   ``(int)``, ``(float)``, ``settype()``) accept all strings, converting
   both numeric and leading-numeric strings and producing 0 for
   non-numeric strings
-  String-to-string comparisons with ``==`` etc perform numeric
   comparison if only both strings are numeric strings
-  String-to-int/float comparisons with ``==`` etc type-juggle the
   string (and thus perform numeric comparison) if it is either a
   numeric string or a non-numeric string

It is notable that while a numeric string may contain leading
whitespace, only a leading-numeric string may contain trailing
whitespace.

The Problem
-----------

The current behaviour of treating strings with leading whitespace as
more numeric than strings with trailing whitespace is inconsistent and
has no obvious benefit. It is an unintuitive, surprising behaviour.

The inconsistency itself can require more work from the programmer. If
rejecting number strings from user input that contain whitespace is
useful to your application — perhaps it must be passed on to a back-end
system that cannot handle whitespace — you cannot rely on e.g.
``is_numeric()`` to make sure of this for you, it only rejects trailing
whitespace; yet simultaneously, if accepting number strings from user
input that contain whitespace is useful to your application — perhaps to
tolerate accidentally copied-and-pasted spaces — you cannot rely on e.g.
``$a + $b`` to make sure of this for you, it only accepts leading
whitespace.

Beyond the inconsistency, the current rejection of trailing whitespace
is annoying for programs reading data from files or similar
whitespace-separated data streams:

.. code:: php

   <?php

   $total = 0;
   foreach (file("numbers.txt") as $number) {
       $total += $number; // Currently produces “Notice: A non well formed numeric value encountered” on every iteration, because $number ends in "\n"
   }
   ?>

Finally, the current behaviour makes `potential simplifications to
numeric string handling </rfc/string_to_number_comparison>`__ less
palatable if they make leading-numeric strings be tolerated in less
places, because of a perception that a lot of existing code may rely on
the tolerance of trailing whitespace.

Proposal
--------

For the next PHP 7.x (currently PHP 7.4), this RFC proposes that
trailing whitespace be accepted in numeric strings just as leading
whitespace is.

For the PHP interpreter, this would be accomplished by modifying the
``is_numeric_string`` C function (and its variants) in the Zend Engine.
This would therefore affect PHP features which make use of this
function, including:

-  `Arithmetic operators </rfc/invalid_strings_in_arithmetic>`__ would
   no longer produce an ``E_NOTICE``-level error when used with a
   numeric string with trailing whitespace
-  The ``int`` and ``float`` type declarations would no longer produce
   an ``E_NOTICE``-level error when passed a numeric string with
   trailing whitespace
-  Type checks for built-in/extension (“internal”) PHP functions would
   no longer produce an ``E_NOTICE``-level error when passed a numeric
   string with trailing whitespace
-  The comparison operators will now consider numeric strings with
   trailing whitespace to be numeric, therefore meaning that, for
   example, ``"123  " == "  123"`` produces ``true``, instead of
   ``false``
-  The ``\is_numeric`` function would return ``true`` for numeric
   strings with trailing whitespace
-  The ``++`` and ``--`` operators woukd convert numeric strings with
   trailing whitespace to integers or floats, as appropriate, rather
   than applying the alphanumeric increment rules

The PHP language specification's `definition of
str-numeric <https://github.com/php/php-langspec/blob/master/spec/05-types.md#the-string-type>`__
would be modified by the addition of ``str-whitespace``\ :sub:```opt```
after ``str-number``.

This change would be almost completely backwards-compatible, as no
string that was previously accepted would now be rejected. However, if
an application relies on trailing whitespace not being considered
well-formed, it would need updating.

RFC Impact
----------

To Existing Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any extension using ``is_numeric_string``, its variants, or other
functions which themselves use it, will be affected.

To Opcache
~~~~~~~~~~

In the patch, all tests pass with Opcache enabled. I am not aware of any
issues arising here.

Unaffected PHP Functionality
----------------------------

This does not affect the filter extension, which handles numeric strings
itself in a different fashion.

Future Scope
------------

If adopted, this would make Nikita Popov's `PHP RFC: Saner string to
number comparisons </rfc/string_to_number_comparison>`__ look more
reasonable.

I would also plan a second RFC in a similar vein to Nikita's, which
would simplify things by removing the concept of leading-numeric
strings: strings are either numeric and accepted, or non-numeric and not
accepted.

Proposed Voting Choices
-----------------------

Per the Voting RFC, there would be a single Yes/No vote requiring a 2/3
majority.

Patches and Tests
-----------------

A pull request for a complete PHP interpreter patch, including a test
file, can be found here: https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2317

I do not yet have a language specification patch.

After the project is implemented, this section should contain

#. the version(s) it was merged to
#. a link to the git commit(s)
#. a link to the PHP manual entry for the feature
#. a link to the language specification section (if any)
